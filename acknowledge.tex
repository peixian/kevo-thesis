This research owes a deep debt to the various people in Iraq, locals and foreigners alike. I owe a debt of gratitude to my advisor, Professor Ismail Alatas, and my thesis reader, Professor Sara Pursely, for their support throughout this entire project.
A thousand thanks to MÃ©lisande Genat for blazing a path for research in Iraq, this research would have been impossible without her. I have to commend Yasmine Mosimann, Haley Bobseine, and Sam Sweeney for their patience and willingness to hear out and challenge my ideas. A special thanks to Abu Shams and Doctor Nofour Abbas, who both helped me greatly in grasping the rich context of Karbala. To my many interviewees that I badgered with questions, many of whom sadly must go unnamed in this thesis, I am forever indebted to the all of you. A great thanks to Arran Walshe and Professor Alix Phillipon for their help throughout the revising process.

Last, but certainly not least, I must thank everyone at the Shrine of Imam Hussein, especially the janitors: Ali, Hussein, and Kassem. Your generosity in opening the rooftop for me every evening to sleep preserved my sanity in those 40 degree summer nights.
