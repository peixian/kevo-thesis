This research owes a deep debt to the various people in Iraq, locals and foreigners alike. A thousand thanks to MÃ©lisande Genat for blazing a path for research in Iraq, this research would have been impossible without her support. I have to commend Yasmine Mosimann, Haley Bobseine, Sam Sweeney, and Arran Walshe for their patience and willingness to hear out and challenge my ideas. A special thanks to Abu Shams and Doctor Nofour Abbas, who both helped me greatly in grasping the rich context of Karbala. To my many interviewees that I badgered with questions, many of whom sadly must go unnamed in this thesis, I owe a deep debt to you all. A great thanks to Professors Alix Phillipon and Sara Pursely for their help in editing and reviewing this thesis, and Professor Ismail Alatas for his advisement throughout the entire process.
