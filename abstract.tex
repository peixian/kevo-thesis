This thesis explores the significance of religious rituals for devout residents in Karbala and the tensions between the laity and clerical classes. It examines the various religious institutions around rituals, including liturgy orators known as \emph{radūd}, Iraqi militias called the Hashd al-Shaabi, and the neighborhood communities referred to as \emph{mūkeb}. Using original ethnographic data from Karbala, I show that lay Karbalaeis are engaged in a complex contestation of the public sphere and play an active role in shaping their own religion.
