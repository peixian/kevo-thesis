This thesis aims to explore the significance of religious rituals for devout residents in a shrine city, with a specific focus on Karbala. By examining the delicate balance between flexibility and rigidity in rituals, the study seeks to understand their role in shaping faith and maintaining followers. The research is centered on two primary objectives: describing the experiences surrounding rituals in Karbala and investigating how these rituals create opportunities for new discourse.
