Among these others, which have transformed into "enemies" in the modern period are the West, apostates, Wahhabism, Jews, Baha'is and feminism. Looking at the rhetorical themes that Shiʻi writers use, the book demonstrates the contrast between the collective positive "We" and the negative threatening "Other" as a major principle in the evolution of Shiʻism as the minority branch of Islam. It offers a complex view of Shiʻi identity combining a sense of victimhood and insecurity together with conviction of intellectual and moral superiority and long-term triumph"--},

The theological and political genealogy of this power struggle can be traced by examining the history of Shia Islam in South Asia. This article provides historical analyses and ethnographic accounts of Shia Islam and how it is practised in London. It investigates the influence of London-based Iranian and Iraqi Shia transnational networks on South Asian Hussainias and those who attend them. While some London-based Shias of South Asian origin conform to the Iran-backed reformist versions of globally standardised ritual commemoration of Ashura, others detest this and search for religious reinterpretations that assert South Asian ways of commemorating the Ashura ritual.},

Supporters of different Shii–Islamist political parties have established transnational links connecting diasporic communities with their countries of origin. These links have shaped and been shaped by religious, political and social dynamics in the Middle East. This article examines how lamentation poetry performed in Shii ritual gatherings is used to articulate political dissent among diasporic communities. The lachrymal expressions and descriptions that characterize Shii lamentation poetry have the ritualistic function of metaphorically identifying participants with Imam Husayn and his cause. Organizers of these gatherings, however, use lamentation poetry to narrate and give meaning to geopolitical developments in the Middle East, especially since the Anglo-American invasion of Iraq and the toppling of Saddam Hussein in 2003. This article constitutes the first attempt to examine the political contextualization of Shii lamentation poetry, embedded within the political discourses of two Shii Islamist parties, the al-Wefaq Movement in Bahrain and Hizbullah in Lebanon. Unlike other studies on Shii ritual practices, it is informed by a multi-sited ethnographic study of female-only and male-dominated ritual spaces in the United Kingdom, Sweden, Lebanon, Iraq and Bahrain.},

These rituals commemorate an event of vital importance to Shia Muslims: the seventh-century death of the Imam Husain, grandson of the Prophet Muhammad, at the battlefield of Karbala in Iraq. Pinault examines three different forms of ritual commemoration of Husain's death - poetry-recital and self-flagellation in Hyderabad; stick-fighting in Darjeeling; and the 'Horse of Karbala' procession, in which a stallion representing the mount ridden in battle by Husain is made the center of a public parade in Ladakh and other Indian localities. The book looks at how publicly staged rituals serve to mediate communal relations: in Hyderabad and Darjeeling, between Muslim and Hindu populations; in Ladakh, between Muslims and Buddhists. Attention is also given to controversies within Muslim communities over issues related to Muharram such as the belief in intercession by the Karbala Martyrs on behalf of individual believers.},

Particularly after the seminal work of Danièle Hervieu-Léger on ‘religion as a chain of memory’, discussions arose around how theories of memory can be applied in the Study of Religions. Few scholars, however, have discussed the intersection between religion, particularly Islam, and memory. In this article, the focus lies on Shii Muslim communities in Ireland, for whom remembering constitutes an important part of their identity and legitimises their particular sectarian existence within Islam in general. This article discusses Iraqi Shii women's engagement in ‘collective remembering’ (Paul Connerton, How Societies Remember, Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1989; J.V. Wertsch, Voices of Collective Remembering, Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 2002) expressed through constantly performed religious rituals and practices.},

	shorttitle = {Imperial {Mecca}},
	abstract = {"With the advent of the steamship, repeated outbreaks of cholera marked oceanic pilgrimages to Mecca as a dangerous form of travel and a vehicle for the globalization of epidemic diseases. European, especially British Indian, officials also feared that lengthy sojourns in Arabia might expose their Muslim subjects to radicalizing influences from anticolonial dissidents and pan-Islamic activists. European colonial empires' newfound ability to set the terms of hajj travel not only affected the lives of millions of pilgrims but also dramatically challenged the Ottoman Empire, the world's only remaining Muslim imperial power. Michael Christopher Low analyzes the late Ottoman hajj and Hijaz region as transimperial spaces, reshaped by the competing forces of Istanbul's project of frontier modernization and the extraterritorial reach of British India's steamship empire in the Indian Ocean and Red Sea. Imperial Mecca recasts Ottoman Arabia as a distant, unstable semi-autonomous frontier that Istanbul struggled to modernize and defend against the onslaught of colonial steamship mobility. As it turned out, steamships carried not just pilgrims, passports, and microbes, but also the specter of legal imperialism and colonial intervention. Over the course of roughly a half century, from the 1850s through World War I, British India's fear of the hajj as a vector of anticolonial subversion gradually gave way to an increasingly sophisticated administrative, legal, and medical protectorate over the steamship hajj, threatening to eclipse the Ottoman state and Caliphate's prized legitimizing claim as protector of Islam's most holy places. Drawing on a wide range of Ottoman and British archival sources, this book sheds new light on the transimperial and global histories traversed along the pilgrimage to Mecca"--},

            The provisioning of potable water was a microcosm of the Ottoman state's incomplete projects of technopolitical modernization on the Arab frontier. Water questions sat at the intersection between international pressures surrounding cholera, drought, Wahhabi and Bedouin disorder, and the inability of the state to impose its will on the semi-autonomous Amirate of Mecca. To be sure, Ottoman public health reforms and increased attention to water infrastructure were partly a product of the intense international attention generated by the hajj's role in the globalization of cholera. However, like other projects with more overt military and strategic implications, most notably the Hijaz telegraph and railway, the Ottoman state also saw an opportunity to harness the increasing medicalization of the hajj to serve a broader set of efforts to consolidate the empire's most vulnerable frontier provinces. Through the lens of the technopolitical frontier this essay seeks to tell a larger story about the evolution of state building and development in Arabia, one that would otherwise be obscured without reference to both its late Ottoman and Saudi histories. By viewing the evolution of hydraulic management in the Hijaz as a continuous process unfolding across the long nineteenth century, we gain a new perspective on the role that Ottoman technopolitics played in shaping the Saudi state that eventually succeeded it. We find that the quest for water security in the Hijaz, particularly in Jidda, played a critical role in setting the stage for the discovery of the Saudi Arabia's massive petroleum reserves.},

I explore the imaginative qualities of the rituals, qualities that I refer to collectively as "virtual recentralization." "Recentralization" connotes the islanders' longing to regain their Cold War status as the focal point between China and Taiwan, even though the desired goal can only be "Virtual" as cross-strait tensions continue to diminish. These pilgrimages, with their eclectic, improvisatory, and novel forms, differ from traditional pilgrimages in important ways: rather than transmitting permanent and solid religious values, they are oriented towards performance and are imbued with elements of fiction and fantasy. They are the means by which the Mazu islanders, in this neoliberal era, imagine their future, reconfigure political, economic, and religious space, and forge new connections between China, Taiwan, and even the wider world.},

Omar Kasmani argues that these pilgrims' affective connections to the site's patron saint, who lived and died in the thirteenth century, lead them to queer forms of living. While some of the ethnographic interlocutors in the book are themselves LGBTQI, and a few are women who trouble the gendered ordering of the shrine, Kasmani attends to the queer forms of relationality, intimacy, and affinity that the site allows for rather than on the individual identities of the people themselves. He shows how their relation to the world is altered by embodied and imaginative modes of moving away from social objects and expectations and toward the saintly. As the site is a state-run national heritage site, Kasmani considers how this form of queer living brings individuals, society, and the state together through a public architecture of intimacy. In tracing the veering paths of these religious figures, Kasmani demonstrates how this form of intimacy might offer not a withdrawal from the world, but rather a different kind of queer worldmaking"--},

Twelve Infallible Men explores the role of stories in the development of a distinctly Shīʻah identity, demonstrating how accounts of saintly figures were popularized to meet the needs of a religious community. This analysis of Shīʻah narratives provides insight into the social and religious significance of stories of the imams, helping explain what made them worth preserving. This book examines a form of biography that emerged around the beginning of the tenth century CE, when Shīʻah scholars began compiling accounts of individual imams into works spanning the lives of all twelve holy figures. These collective biographies canonized particular versions of the lives and deaths of the imams, in the process constructing a sacred history. The themes and motifs found in these biographies reveal the concerns of Shīʻah Muslim communities in the medieval period. Shīʻah accounts of the imams' lives often differed significantly from those of their adversaries, reflecting an emotionally-charged conflict about issues of religious authority and legitimacy. The collective biographies imbued select memories of the imams' lives with religious significance, thereby demarcating communal boundaries in enduring ways. The stories inspired and entertained, but more importantly they offered consolation to a community searching for meaning at a new stage of history. They became the focal point of communal memory, inspiring Shīʻah religious imagination for centuries to come."--Provided by publisher},

Accordingly, the table of contents resembles a family portrait, and features synthetic articles as well as case studies which cover the medieval, modern and contemporary periods, throughout different parts of the Muslim world (Maghrib and Mashriq, Anatolia, Iran, India, Pakistan and Central Asia).

Results from our microbenchmark show that when applied to a lock-free linked list, Hazard Eras will match the throughput of Hazard Pointers in the worst-case, and can outperform Hazard Pointers by a factor of 5x.

According to Najaf tradition, it has been so ever since the prominent scholar Muhammad b. al-Hasan al-Tüst, called shaykh al-tä'ifa or "senior scholar of the the sect", migrated there shortly after the Saljuq conquest of Baghdad in 447/1055. We have very little information about the teaching system and curriculum in Najaf before the nineteenth century. In this essay, I will try to present the basic elements of a Najaf hawza education as they exist in contemporary Iraq and compare it with a Najaf curriculum of igij. Quite remarkably, the curriculum, teaching methods and patronage networks have been remarkably stable over the last century. Politics and reform movements have, however, had their effects on the curriculum too, as I shall explain in the course of this essay.},

	abstract = {The Shikoku pilgrimage, a 1400-kilometre, eighty-eight-temple circuit around Japan’s fourth largest island, takes around forty days by foot and a week by car. Historically Buddhist ascetics walked it incessantly, creating a tradition of unending pilgrimage that continues in the present era, both by pilgrims on foot and by those in cars. Some spend decades walking the pilgrimage, while others drive repeatedly and do hundreds of pilgrimage circuits. Most are retired and make the pilgrimage the centre of their post-work lives, while others work full-time but spend their free time and weekends as pilgrims. Some have only done the pilgrimage a few times but already imagine themselves as unending pilgrims and intend to do it ‘until we die’. They talk, happily, of being addicted and having
              Shikokubyō
              , ‘Shikoku illness’, while portraying such ‘illness’ and addiction as blessings. This book, based in extensive fieldwork, shows that unending pilgrimage is
              the
              dominant theme of the Shikoku pilgrimage and argues that this is not specific to Shikoku but found widely in global contexts, although it has barely been examined in studies of pilgrimage. It counteracts normative portrayals of pilgrimage as a transient activity involving temporarily leaving home to visit sacred places outside the everyday parameters of life; rather, pilgrimage for many participants means creating a sense of home and permanence on the road. As such this book presents new theoretical perspectives on pilgrimage in general, along with rich ethnographic examples of pilgrimage practices in contemporary Japan.},

He traces the history of Bosnia and its Muslims from the Nazi German and Fascist Italian occupation of Yugoslavia in 1941 to the Yugoslav civil war, concluding with the Communists' establishment of a new Yugoslav state. Hoare reveals Bosnian Muslim's opposition to the new Nazi and Fascist order, detailing the different reasons behind and forms of their resistance. He describes how the Yugoslav Communists harnessed Muslim opposition to support their own resistance movement, which fundamentally decided the character and outcome of the Communist revolution. Yet despite this aid, the victorious Communists turned their back on their Muslim allies as they consolidated their power, setting the scene for future conflicts over the political and social place of Yugoslavia's Muslims. --Amazon.com},

They were looking out for the return of the Messiah, who would, after prolonged battle, triumph over the Great Deceiver, the Antichrist, who had taken over to rule the world. Although this apocalyptic mood rose and wore off almost cyclically, postponing the end of the world to the next turn of the century, this time it seemed as if the expectations were extraordinarily high. After all, quite a number of Muslims felt that the world had indeed become ruled by the Great Deceiver.},

            Was the destruction of Sufi and ‘Alid saint shrines as a rite of conquest in Iran and Central Asia a phenomenon comparable to the desecration of temples in war in India? With this question in mind, this essay examines the changing nature of Islamic kingship in premodern Iran and Central Asia and compares it to developments in Indic kingship. It begins with the thesis that the decline of the caliphate and the rise of Muslim saints and shrines in thirteenth-century Iran and Central Asia led to a new form of “shrine-centered” sovereignty practiced by the rulers of these regions. This development, in turn, gave rise to a notable pattern in which Muslim kings threatened or attacked the shrines of their enemies’ patron saints in times of war. A focus on this ritual violence, which remains neglected in the studies of Islamic iconoclasm and jihad, reveals how the protocols of violence and accommodation that governed these Muslim milieus became analogous to those enacted by Indic kings who also sacked temples of rival sovereigns in times of war. With the spread of Muslim shrines and the related belief that the “real” sovereign was not the caliph but the enshrined saint, Islam and Hinduism developed comparable grammars of “gifting” and “looting.” This argument allows for a new, transcultural perspective to examine the premodern history of India, Iran, and Central Asia, connected by the rise of Muslim saints and their shrines.},

Using Hourani's Arabic Thought in the Liberal Age, 1798-1939 (Cambridge, 1962) as a starting point, it reassesses Arabic cultural production and political thought in the light of current scholarship and extends the analysis beyond Napoleon's invasion of Egypt and the outbreak of World War II. The chapters offer a mixture of broad-stroke history on the construction of 'the Muslim world,' and the emergence of the rule of law and constitutionalism in the Ottoman empire, as well as case studies on individual Arab intellectuals that illuminate the transformation of modern Arabic thought"--},

This article transcribes, translates, and analyses the lament to showcase a distinct religious tradition within a hybrid cultural milieu. The lament’s forms intersect with Arabic poetic conventions set in pre-Islamic times; its themes overlap with Twelver-Shīʿī Karbala laments in Arabic, Persian, and Urdu from the Middle East and South Asia; and its performance stems from melodic Persianate-Urdu recital. Simultaneously, it reflects the Fāṭimid-Ṭayyibī heritage, particularly the teachings of al-Muʾayyad al-Shīrāzī (d. 470/1078), including the fundamentals of their Imāmate doctrine and the salvific importance of weeping for Ḥusayn.},

	abstract = {In the pursuit of explaining implicit regularization in deep learning, prominent focus was given to matrix and tensor factorizations, which correspond to simpliﬁed neural networks. It was shown that these models exhibit an implicit tendency towards low matrix and tensor ranks, respectively. Drawing closer to practical deep learning, the current paper theoretically analyzes the implicit regularization in hierarchical tensor factorization, a model equivalent to certain deep convolutional neural networks. Through a dynamical systems lens, we overcome challenges associated with hierarchy, and establish implicit regularization towards low hierarchical tensor rank. This translates to an implicit regularization towards locality for the associated convolutional networks. Inspired by our theory, we design explicit regularization discouraging locality, and demonstrate its ability to improve the performance of modern convolutional networks on non-local tasks, in deﬁance of conventional wisdom by which architectural changes are needed. Our work highlights the potential of enhancing neural networks via theoretical analysis of their implicit regularization.},

	shorttitle = {Caravan of martyrs},
	abstract = {"In Caravan of Martyrs, David Edwards argues that we need to understand the rise of suicide bombing in relation to the cultural beliefs and ritual practices associated with sacrifice. Before the war in Afghanistan began, the sacrificial killing of a sheep demonstrated a tribe's desire for peace. After the Soviet invasion of 1979, as thousands of people were killed, sacrifice took on new meanings. The dead were venerated as martyrs, but this informal conferral of status on the casualties of war soon became the foundation for a cult of martyrs exploited by political leaders for their own advantage. This first repurposing of the machinery of sacrifice set in motion a process of mutation that would lead nineteen Arabs who had received their training in Afghanistan to hijack airplanes on September 11 and that would in time transform what began as an Afghan-centered cult of martyrs into the transnational scattering of suicide bombers that haunts our world today. Drawing on years of research in the region, Edwards traces the transformation of sacrifice using a wide range of sources, including the early poetry of jihad, illustrated martyr magazines, school primers and legal handbooks, martyr hagiographies, videos produced by suicide bombers, the manual of ritual instructions used by the 9/11 hijackers, and Facebook posts through which contemporary 'Talifans' promote the virtues of self-destruction"--Provided by publisher},

The contributors come from a variety of intellectual traditions and are wide-ranging in their ethnographic approach. Each essay invites readers to take a step back from concepts, fieldwork, and theories and center on the elusive work that needs to be performed before an argument can be completed. More specifically, the essays explore the deliberate processes for nurturing a space of play for things that have not yet materialized, opening up ways of experimental thinking through ethnographic knowing"--},

	abstract = {Driven by the goal of eradicating language barriers on a global scale, machine translation has solidified itself as a key focus of artificial intelligence research today. However, such efforts have coalesced around a small subset of languages, leaving behind the vast majority of mostly low-resource languages. What does it take to break the 200 language barrier while ensuring safe, high quality results, all while keeping ethical considerations in mind? In No Language Left Behind, we took on this challenge by first contextualizing the need for low-resource language translation support through exploratory interviews with native speakers. Then, we created datasets and models aimed at narrowing the performance gap between low and high-resource languages. More specifically, we developed a conditional compute model based on Sparsely Gated Mixture of Experts that is trained on data obtained with novel and effective data mining techniques tailored for low-resource languages. We propose multiple architectural and training improvements to counteract overfitting while training on thousands of tasks. Critically, we evaluated the performance of over 40,000 different translation directions using a human-translated benchmark, Flores-200, and combined human evaluation with a novel toxicity benchmark covering all languages in Flores-200 to assess translation safety. Our model achieves an improvement of 44\% BLEU relative to the previous state-of-the-art, laying important groundwork towards realizing a universal translation system. Finally, we open source all contributions described in this work, accessible at https://github.com/facebookresearch/fairseq/tree/nllb.},

In this article I examine key factors driving IOM’s expansion, and implications for the forced migration regime. Despite lacking a formal protection mandate, IOM has thrived by acting as an entrepreneur, capitalizing on its malleability and reputation for efficiency, and carving out distinctive roles in activities including post-disaster camp management, data collection, and assistance for migrant workers in crises. I reflect on IOM’s efforts to accrue increased authority and power, and suggest that understanding IOM’s humanitarian engagements is now essential to understanding the organization itself and, increasingly, the forced migration regime.},

He defined a bullshit job as 'a form of paid employment that is so completely pointless, unnecessary, or pernicious that even the employee cannot justify its existence, even though as part of the conditions of employment, the employee feels obliged to pretend that this is not the case.' After a million views in seventeen different languages, people all over the world are still debating the answer. ... Graeber, in his singularly searing and illuminating style, identifies the five types of bullshit jobs and argues that when 1 percent of the population controls most of a society's wealth, they control what jobs are 'useful' and 'important.' ... Graeber illustrates how nurses, bus drivers, musicians, and landscape gardeners provide true value, and what it says about us as a society when we look down upon them. Using arguments from some of the most revered political thinkers, philosophers, and scientists of our time, Graeber articulates the societal and political consequences of these bullshit jobs. Depression, anxiety, and a warped sense of our values are all dire concerns. He provides a blueprint to undergo a shift in values, placing creative and caring work at the center of our culture, providing the meaning and satisfaction we all crave."--Jacket},

The volume features an international panel of contributors who develop an innovative picture of religion as a culturally-created social institution; religiosity as a more personal and subjective anthropological element of people expressed through religion; and theology as the study of god. To survive in changing times, living systems - a good characterization of religion, religiosity and theology - all must adaptively evolve. This is a vital study of a rapidly burgeoning field. As such, it will be of great interest to scholars in religious studies and theology as well as in the psychological, sociological, and anthropological study of religion"--},

The latter rejected the efforts of leading Iraqi and Syrian jurists to apply ijtiha¯d (rational legal inference), hadith categorization, and dira¯ya (scrutiny and stratification of accounts) in deriving Shi i law. The main studies on Astarabadi’s akhba¯r¯ı (traditionist) movement treat it as a reaction to the “influence” of Sunnism on the mujtahids or to their excessive “borrowings” from it, and stress the traditionists’ abhorrence of assimilating any aspect of Sunnism. Underlining the shortcomings of these explanations, this article presents Astarabadi’s thought as a discursive development within the Shi i juristic tradition, which is part of the grand Islamic tradition. Astarabadi became skeptical of the mujtahids’ epistemology and methodology and was concerned that they jeopardized God’s law and hence the believer’s salvation. He protested the Safavid monarchs’ legitimation of us. u¯l¯ı legal authority, the latter’s hierarchical features, and, ultimately, the sociopolitical domination of the Amili mujtahids from Jabal Amil in Syria (or modern-day South Lebanon), starting with al-Muhaqqiq al-Karaki (d. 1534).},

The aim of the study is to understand how authenticity is evoked in a religious pilgrimage and the relationship between authenticity, rituals and consumption. The research contributes ethnographic insights from a lesser known, yet significant, Muslim pilgrimage called Ziyara-t-Arba’een. In so doing, pilgrimages are conceptualised as a quest for spiritual authenticity, a hybrid form of existential, ideological and objective authenticity. The findings section leads to a discussion of the ways in which spiritual authenticity is realised through rituals and the consumption of texts, material objects and space. The contribution of this paper is threefold: 1) it explores the different dimensions of authenticity in a pilgrimage experience; 2) it examines the role of material culture and ritual consumption in achieving forms of authenticity; and 3) it broadens the understanding of the pilgrimage as a context-bound and culturally specific phenomenon.},

	abstract = {Abstract
            Two primary impulses have historically motivated the Iraqi Shi'i juristic establishment in its relations with the Iraqi state. The first, deeply embedded in centuries of Islamic jurisprudence, is to achieve maximum autonomy for the Shi'i community from the state. The second has developed more recently in response to the modern state's efforts to extend its hegemonic control over areas that premodern empires were content either to leave to the jurists to administer or at least to share the administration of with jurists. This is to have the state recognize and implement Shi'i rules within parts of the state infrastructure that are of core interest to the juristic establishment. There is an obvious tension between these two desires, nowhere more evident than in the subject of this article—namely, the law pertaining to the creation, management, and liquidation of the Islamic charitable land trust known as the waqf. On the one hand, Article 43 of Iraq's constitution declares the followers of religions and sects to be “free” in administering the waqfs and their affairs, suggesting a strong desire for autonomy and separation from state control. Yet the implementing legislation for this provision extends the existence of a thick state bureaucracy and hands its administration over to juristic authorities. The ultimate irony of this arrangement is that it subjects juristic forces to far more potential interference as a legal matter than they have ever been subjected to, even during the totalitarian rule of the Ba'ath. In the end, a religious establishment historically deeply suspicious of political rulers and political engagement—indeed, one that defines itself by virtue of its separation from the state—now finds itself deeply and dangerously entangled in state political and administrative affairs. This article explores how this came to be and some of the significant consequences that arise from it.},

I undertake a journey among Iranian Shi’i youth to trace the unarticulated and the sense of wonder generated via religious experiences. By way of an ethnography of Muharram lamentation ceremonies, this article highlights how the unarticulated and the unsaid are socially and politically used in service of Shi’i militancy. I explore those uncharted terrains in the darkness of the Lacanian Real and in terms of how the Real is authenticated in order to address how realities are crafted and religious subjectivities are enacted in the realm of militancy.},

	abstract = {A hawza is the establishment responsible for the training of Shia Islam’s imams, preachers, professors, and researchers. For hundreds of years, its educational model has involved the teaching of Fikh, Usul, philosophy, Quranic studies and Arabic language. Over the past few decades, the social sciences—the systematic study of man and society which had emerged in the West—have been slowly making their way into these institutions, alongside a number of other changes. This article investigates, qualitatively, the religious training of Shia men of religion in Lebanon in order to explore the changes taking place within this institution. Based on a triangulation of participant observation, interviews with professors, students, and stakeholders, as well as content analysis of certain course material, it claims a hawza in metamorphosis. While structural and material alterations have straightforwardly made their way into the institution, content and curricular ones have faced more difficulty. These changes reveal plenty about both Islamic education and Shia Islam in Lebanon’s public sphere. Additionally, the article raises questions and insights regarding decolonial theory, Lebanon’s future, and the geopolitics of the Arab world.},

In Lebanon, with the fall of the Ottoman Empire and the imposition of French colonial rule, many of these endowments reverted to private property circulating in the marketplace. In contemporary Beirut, however, charitable endowments have resurged as mosques, Islamic centers, and non-profit organizations. A historical anthropology in dialogue with Islamic law, God's Property demonstrates how these endowments have been drawn into secular logics-no longer the property of God but of the Muslim community-and shaped by the modern state and modern understandings of charity and property. Although these transformations produced new kinds of loyalties and new ways of being in society, Moumtaz's ethnography reveals the furtive persistence of endowment practices that perpetuate older ways of thinking of one's self and one's responsibilities toward family and state"--},

These guarantees are usually provided via statemachine replication (SMR). Recent advances in SMR have focused on leaderless protocols, which improve the availability and performance of traditional Paxos-based solutions. We propose Tempo – a leaderless SMR protocol that, in comparison to prior solutions, achieves superior throughput and offers predictable performance even in contended workloads. To achieve these benefits, Tempo timestamps each application command and executes it only after the timestamp becomes stable, i.e., all commands with a lower timestamp are known. Both the timestamping and stability detection mechanisms are fully decentralized, thus obviating the need for a leader replica. Our protocol furthermore generalizes to partial replication settings, enabling scalability in highly parallel workloads. We evaluate the protocol in both real and simulated geo-distributed environments and demonstrate that it outperforms state-of-the-art alternatives.},

Love letters written by young village residents illustrate how love came to be reconceptualized during this time period as a desirable rather than an embarrassing emotion, one linked up with other achievements perceived as admirable, such as education, development and success. Because love letter correspondences were only made possible by increased female literacy rates in the village, the article also explores some of the socioculturally and historically speciﬁc impacts of the acquisition of literacy skills on gender hierarchies and intimate relationships.},

natives of Hindoostan, and attemper them with the mild spirit of British government.—John Bruce
            Jurisprudence is the nexus where authoritative texts, cultural assumptions, and political expediency come together during a crisis. It is 
therefore not so much a thing or a system as it is an experience, an interpretative experience. Yet the practice of 
jurisprudence is very different from other types of interpretation because it is also an exertion of power. A legal 
interpretation is a decision which mobilizes coercive forces to immediately solidify the interpretation into a social 
reality. The administrative structure of courts and the legal rhetoric that flows through them disguise jurisprudence as 
‘a system’ rather than revealing its nature as an interpretative experience; this disguise serves to heighten the authority 
of these exercises of power and to limit the ability to contest them to specialists.},

Contrary to the view that colonial judges consistently reinforced the patriarchal authority of husbands in direct and immediate ways, it suggests that some colonial judges were working in the service of their own chivalric imperialist agenda: the defence of Muslim wives. The article focuses on two particular moves. First, colonial judges encouraged the use of inflated dower, a device intended to make the husband's power of triple talāq too expensive to use. Colonial legislators invalidated inflated dower in various parts of India, but judges confirmed the validity of inflated dower sums whenever possible. Second, judges expanded the use of delegated divorce, a device that helped Muslim wives counter their husbands' right to polygamy and unilateral divorce. In doing so, judges undermined the restricted approach to delegation taken by colonial treatises on Anglo-Islamic law.},

@article{siddiqui_draft_nodate,
	title = {{DRAFT}, {NOT} {FOR} {DISTRIBUTION}},
	abstract = {The jural colonization of Islamic law in India is predominantly read through the translation of key Ḥanafī fiqh texts in the early colonial period and the adjudication of legal cases that often relied upon these texts. Ostensibly missing in this discussion is uṣūl al-fiqh. To what extent were colonial officials concerned with uṣūl al-fiqh? Were there any texts of uṣūl al-fiqh penned under the guise of jural colonization? And if so, what do these texts reveal about the Ḥanafī tradition in the British colonial period? This essay will analyze the first text of uṣūl alfiqh, The Principles of Muhammadan Jurisprudence, penned in the late 19th century by a prominent Muslim judge, Abdur Rahim (1867-1952), working within the colonial jural project. Abdur Rahim’s impetus for writing his text was to respond to specific critiques of Islamic law that characterized it as an incoherent legal system that could not generate legal certainty. For Abdur Rahim, a deeper understanding of uṣūl al-fiqh by British judges would address both of these critiques. Through exploring his text, I argue that despite his lack of ostensible madrasa training in the Ḥanafī legal tradition, Abdur Rahim is able to situate his text within the intellectual development of the Ḥanafī school. However, because his text was intended for the British colonial elite, Abdur Rahim minimizes the importance of key features of Ḥanafī uṣūl alfiqh and ultimately produces a text that reflective more of madhhab eclecticism.},

	abstract = {Modern state law is an expansive force that permeates life and politics. Law's histories—colonial, revolutionary, and postcolonial—tell of its constitutive centrality to the making of colonies and modern states. Its powers intertwine with life itself; they attempt to direct it, shape its most intimate spheres, decide on the constitutive line dividing public from private, and take over the space and time in which life unfolds. These powers settle in the present, eliminate past authorities, and dictate futures. Gendering and constitutive of sexual difference, law's powers endeavor to mold subjects and alter how they orient themselves to others and to the world. But these powers are neither coherent nor finite. They are ripe with contradictions and conflicting desires. They are also incapable of eliminating other authorities, paths, and horizons of living; these do not vanish but remain not only thinkable and articulable but also a resource for the living. Such are some of the overlapping and accumulative interventions of the two books under review: Sara Pursley's
              Familiar Futures
              and Judith Surkis's
              Sex, Law, and Sovereignty in French Algeria
              . What follows is an attempt to further develop these interventions by thinking with some of the books’ underlying arguments.
              Familiar Futures
              is a history of Iraq, beginning with the British colonial-mandate period and concluding with the 1958 Revolution and its immediate aftermath.
              Sex, Law, and Sovereignty
              is a history of “French Algeria” that covers a century of French colonization from 1830 to 1930. The books converge on key questions concerning how modern law and the modern state—colonial and postcolonial—articulated sexual difference and governed social and intimate life, including through the rise of personal-status law as a separate domain of law constitutive of the conjugal family. Both books are consequently also preoccupied with the relationship between sex, gender, and sovereignty. And both contain resources for living along paths not charted by the modern state and its juridical apparatus.},

By exploring their daily interactions with imperial elites as well as villagers and marauders, Chatterjee offers a new history from below of the Mughal Empire, far from the glittering courts of the emperors and nobles, but still dramatic and filled with colourful personalities. From this perspective, we see war, violence, betrayal, enterprise, romance and disappointment, but we also see a quest for law, justice, rights and righteousness. A rare story of Islamic law in a predominantly non-Muslim society, this is also an exploration of the peripheral regions of the Maratha empire and a neglected princely state under British colonial rule.

Through an analysis of two risiilas on this issue, one by an Akhbarl and the other by an U{\textasciitilde}iill, I aim to demonstrate that the relationship between U:fUl alfiqh and substantive law in the Akhbarl school differed from that in the U{\textasciitilde}iill school, and that this difference was not due to their two different legal theories alone, but stems from two divergent conceptions of the function of legal theory and its role in the derivation of legal rulings.},

              This article proposes a comparative analytical framework to study changes in Islamic law during the post-Mongol period, particularly the rise of the official school of law (or state
              madhhab
              ). Taking as my case study the Ottoman adoption of a particular branch within the Sunni Hanafi school of law, I suggest that this adoption marks a new chapter in Islamic legal history. In earlier periods, while rulers appointed judges and thus regulated the adjudication procedures, they did not intervene, at least theoretically, in the structure and doctrine of the schools of law, which remained the relatively autonomous realm of the jurists. The Ottoman adoption of the school, by contrast, was not merely an act of state patronage, since the dynasty played an important role in regulating the school's structure and doctrine. To this end, it employed a set of administrative and institutional practices, such as the development of an imperial learned hierarchy with standardized career and training tracks and the appointment of jurisconsults (muftis). Some of these practices were found in other polities across the eastern Islamic lands in the post-Mongol period, but these similarities have not been treated comparatively in modern historiography. They suggest that the Ottoman case was part of a broader legal culture that spanned several polities across the region. This article outlines a framework that will enable historians of Islamic law to treat these similarities in a more coherent manner. The framework raises key issues in the historiography of Islamic law and its nineteenth-century modernization.},

            Fetva collections are important sources for Islamic legal history. However, few scholars have considered a particular collection of fetvas or the fetvas of an individual jurist as specific areas of legal and historical exploration. Instead, most researchers use fetvas selectively and instrumentally, that is in (at best) small groups, and in their explorations of various other topics. This article proposes computational methodologies that could characterize the contents of a 6,000-fetva corpus by an important Ottoman jurist, Şeyhülislam Ebussuud Efendi (d. 1574), to reveal its substantive composition and range. The article conceptualizes a previously uncharted textual space in a way similar to how a map depicts a geographical one. By doing so, it also provides insights into Ebussuud’s jurisprudential legacy and the major socio-legal concerns and anxieties in the Ottoman Empire during the sixteenth century.},

Historians have treated these opinions as part of the vast polemical literature uniformly intended to justify an impending Ottoman attack against their Safavid rivals. Questioning the notion that all authors shared an undifferentiated attitude, this article underlines that, unlike most polemical literature, the opinions of these three jurists focused on the religiolegal aspects of the Safavid issue and varied and evolved in line with changing historical realities, the jurists’ divergent assessments of the Safavid threat, and their preference for different jurisprudential doctrines. Based on an analysis of the opinions, I argue that these jurists assumed a high degree of autonomy as producers and interpreters of the law and thus did not necessarily feel obliged to legitimate or excuse every imperial action.},

	abstract = {Abstract
            This article investigates the socio-discursive processes that have enabled the emergence and maintenance of pilgrimage practice by examining the rising popularity of the Ḥaḍramawt valley of southern Yemen as a pilgrimage destination for Indonesian Muslims. Pilgrimage to Ḥaḍramawt mainly revolves around visiting the tombs of Bā ʿAlawī (a group of Ḥaḍramīs who claim direct descent from the Prophet Muḥammad) Sufi saints and scholars scattered around the valley. Moving away from ritual analysis, I examine the roles of various actors involved in the production and consumption of pilgrimage. I analyze pilgrimage as a poetic project that frames travel as a transformative process. As a project, pilgrimage can be described as poetic because it hinges on the construction of multiple chronotopes that are juxtaposed, compared, contrasted, and assembled into meaningful alignments. The actors discussed are involved in producing chronotopes of Ḥaḍramawt as a spiritually idealized place, which are made to resonate with mass-mediated chronotopes of idealized Islam circulating among Indonesian Muslims, and contrasted with chronotopes of the modern world. Framed by such a poetic mediation, pilgrims comprehend their actual travel to Ḥaḍramawt as a cross-chronotopic movement that they believe transforms their own selves. The article observes the various mechanisms of attraction and seduction at work in pilgrimage practice, while demonstrating the structural similarities between pilgrimage and other forms of tourism.},

The two empires were linked by both migration and unfreedom; alongside Russian slaves forcibly brought to the sultans’ domains, many others came as fugitives from serfdom and conscription. But beginning in the late 18th century, the Ottoman Empire reinforced Russian serfdom and conscription by agreeing to return fugitives, even as the same treaties undermined Ottoman forced labor by mandating the return of Russian slaves. Drawing extensively on Ottoman archival sources, this article argues that the resulting interimperial regulations on unfreedom and movement hardened the empires’ human and geographic boundaries, so that for many Russian subjects, foreign subjecthood under treaty law was not a privilege, but a liability.},

It also contrasts Hamidian-era mobility control efforts with those of the Ottoman state following the 1908 Young Turk Revolution, revealing points of both convergence and divergence. It asserts that these efforts reveal many of the broader contradictions and tensions of the Ottoman modernization process of the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, and argues for understanding the Ottoman case as part of the broader global story of mobility and migration control.},

To date, historians have explained this decision only in political or ideological terms, paying little attention to its implications for the judicial system. Here I argue that the purpose of the new quadruple structure of the judiciary was two-fold: to create a uniform but at the same time flexible legal system. The need for predictable and stable legal rules was addressed by limiting q¨´ÂsÕ discretion and promoting taqlÂd, i.e., adherence to established school doctrine. The establishment of Chief Q¨´Âs from the four schools of law, on the other hand, allowed for flexibility and prevented the legal system from becoming too rigid. The quadruple judiciary enabled litigants, regardless of personal school affiliation, to choose from the doctrines of the four schools.},

            Current scholarship on the legal doctrine of jihād presents classical Sunni jurists after the second/eighth century as uniformly championing continual imperial conquest. In this article, I suggest that this sweeping claim for a uniform doctrine neglects what is distinctive in the argumentation of individual juristic thinkers. I trace the genealogy of of Burhān al-Dīn al-Marghīnānī’s (d. 593/1197) theory of jihād in order to show how he radically reinterpreted the doctrine of Ḥanafī school. He introduced the novel approach that jihād need not to be equated with its outward, formal meaning (al-jihād ṣūratan) of military combat. Rather, beyond that outward sense, jihād also had a deeper meaning (al-jihād maʿnan) based on its purpose or function within international relations. For Marghīnānī, part of this function was the preservation of life, freedom, and property. He was thus able to argue that, so long as they secured these ends, peace treaties fulfilled the deeper meaning of jihad. Marghīnānī’s ideas enabled a shift in Ḥanafī thought whereby jurists after him associated jihād with the realization of benefit (maṣlaḥa) for Muslim society. Rather than advocate the obligation of continual conquest, these jurists accepted that decision-making about war and peace should be determined by pragmatic considerations of social interest.},

The effectiveness of a "modularization" is dependent upon the criteria used in dividing the system into modules. A system design problem is presented and both a conventional and unconventional decomposition are described. It is shown that the unconventional decompositions have distinct advantages for the goals outlined. The criteria used in arriving at the decompositions are discussed. The unconventional decomposition, if implemented with the conventional assumption that a module consists of one or more subroutines, will be less efficient in most cases. An alternative approach to implementation which does not have this effect is sketched.},

By analysing a letter attributed to the ninth Imami Imam, Muḥammad al-Jawād dated to the year of his death in 220/835, I show that the Imami Shiʿa were defined also by institutional structures that tied them to their Imam in his capacity as community leader. Details of transmission, form and content suggest that the letter may well be authentic, giving us a unique window onto the Imamic administration. The letter is a tax demand, encouraging payment of the khums levy upon the spoils of war and other items. My analysis suggests that the understanding of khums and ghanīma among Imamis at this time continued to be fluid, subject to the Imam’s adjustment, and that implementation influenced the elaboration of the law. Subsequently, hadith scholars and jurists were thus forced to interpret how such ad hoc, pragmatic acts fit into Islamic law, which is conceived as eternal and divine.},

To demarcate the contours of a historical process of Muslim identity construction, I analyze Islamic jurisprudential debates about who is and who is not obligated to pay the charity tax. Most late antique and medieval jurists made the charity tax incumbent on minors or others lacking full legal capacity, even though these groups were exempt from “for-thedivine” practices. I suggest Muslim citizenship as a framework for understanding late antique Muslim identity. Because charity tax liability had socio-political and economic implications, it functioned simultaneously as a gate into and out of a Muslim community. This article contributes to the discourse on Islamic beginnings by exploring the intricacies of Muslim self-conceptions in late antiquity.},

Based on sources from the 2nd century AH, I argue that the institution of waqf emerged from a fusion of two earlier institutions: (1) the ḥabs fī sabīl Allāh, a permanent endowment for pious purposes that probably originated in voluntary contributions to jihād; and (2) the ḥabs in favor of persons, originally a life estate, which probably had its roots in an earlier institution called ʿumrā. Over the course of the 2nd century AH, the legitimacy of life estates was increasingly challenged, and the doctrine on ḥabs in favor of persons was gradually modified until the institution eventually lost its temporary character. By the end of the 2nd century, the ḥabs in favor of persons had become a variation of the ḥabs fī sabīl Allāh: It was accepted as valid only if the settlor stipulated that after the beneficiaries’ death the donation should become a permanent endowment for a pious purpose.},

Study of the documents is an indispensable enterprise if we are to fully understand “how law worked in practice.” In view of what we know to have been “heaps” of documents produced by Muslim judges and notaries, Rustow underscores how particularly noticeable a disjuncture there is between those documents and the long-form texts. Moreover, scholars often skip over and thus fail to avail themselves of the utility of documents in adding texture to social and legal history. She cautions social historians against “pseudo-knowledge,” that is, the temptation to overlook complex factors, usually embedded in legal documents, that render our otherwise tame scholarly perception of the past truer but more “unruly.” In the end, her invitation to join her in the study of documents and thereby improve the state of Islamic legal history is terse and timely: “Please go find yourself some documents.”},

In this essay, I compare the early Islamic legal literature with the pattern of matrimonial gifts recorded in marriage contracts and divorce deeds preserved from early Islamic Egypt. In marriage settlements recorded in the papyri, the groom gave a ×ad¨q that was divided into advance and deferred portions, and brides brought to the marriage a counterpart dowry (jih¨z or shiw¨r). These marriage settlements, which were common to Muslims, Copts and Jews, resembled the Egyptian marriage settlements of late antiquity. The Islamic legal literature preserves the objections of contemporary jurists, including M¨lik, to these Egyptian practices, which they initially regarded as an objectionable innovation. Eventually, the local traditions were incorporated, albeit with modifications, into the legal discourse.},

	abstract = {"Trading at the Speed of Light tells the story of how many of our most important financial markets have transformed from physical trading floors on which human beings trade face-to-face, into electronic systems within which computer algorithms trade with each other. Tracing the emergence of ultrafast, automated, high-frequency trading (HFT) since the early 2000s, Donald MacKenzie draws particular attention to the importance of what he deems the 'material political economy' of twenty-first century finance. Fast transmission of price data used to involve fibre-optic cables, but the strands in such cables are made of materials (usually a specialised form of glass) which slow light down to around two-thirds of its speed in free space. By contrast, microwave and other wireless signals used in HFT travel through the atmosphere at nearly full light speed. At these nanosecond speeds, the physical nature of information transmission and the precise spatial location of the equipment involved become hugely important, thus creating inevitable pinch points in the system. MacKenzie details the ways in which these pinch points - individual frequency bands, specific locations on the roofs of computer data centres, and particular sites for microwave towers - are especially advantageous, making it possible for those who control them to profit from that control. The book draws from over 300 interviews conducted with high-frequency traders around the world, the people who supply them with technological systems and communication links, exchange staff and regulators, as well as with others who function within markets that have not yet become dominated by HFT. MacKenzie focuses most closely upon the four main sites of international HFT - Chicago, New York, Amsterdam, and London - and examines both the technology and the politics underpinning modern financial markets"--},

These ideas come from his reading of Ibn Khaldun, Sigmund Freud and Karl Mannheim. He reinterpreted their ideas of the mind and applied it to Iraqi society and the Iraqi mind. He believes that human nature is egocentric and determined in most actions, motivated by the subconscious. The role of the mind is to justify human behaviour. The mind is one-sided and biased and is untrustworthy. It is only an organ that aids humans in their quest for survival. Also the mind has a limited capacity and is surrounded by a dense rim of values, beliefs and interests. Al-Wardi has launched a relentless campaign against the Aristotelian logic and against reason and rationality. Despite his rational analysis, he could not free himself from the mindset he identified as a farce and did not distinguish between the productive and the instrumental mind.},

	abstract = {The Arab world today is encountering a destructive resurgence of sectarianism, which, up to a few years ago, had been confined to books and rhetorical debates. In the first half of the 20th century, Iraqi sociologist Ali Al-Wardi pioneered the critique of sectarianism in the Arab world. Unlike others, he approached the issue from a specific and unique perspective. His observations of Iraqi history were made from a sociological standpoint that aimed at revealing the impact of sectarianism on Iraqi politics. Al-Wardi's writings were carried out to two phases: the first extends from the early 1950s to the early 1960s; and the second covers the period between the publication of his two books, Study on the Nature of Iraqi Society (the year of publication is unknown) and Social Briefs from the Modern History of Iraq (1971). The first phase focused on Islam's heritage and a number of social phenomena; the second focused exclusively on the study of Iraqi society. A number of factors influenced Al-Wardi's personality and thinking, a fact especially evident in the kind of methodology he used, which was new when addressing the sectarian issue. Based on Al-Wardi's research, this paper traces the historical factors and process that affected the historical development of the divisions separating two main sects of Islam – Shi'a and Sunni – resulting in a duel between them, which led to the configuration of Iraqi society along sectarian lines. It elaborates on the methodology used by Al-Wardi in his studies of Iraqi society, as well as his attitude with regard to sectarianism in modern Iraq. It also explores the intellectual and political influences that helped shape his thinking in this domain and its legacy on sociological thought in the Arab world.},

Due to the complexity of this language and the number of corresponding challenges for NLP, many surveys have been conducted, in order to synthesise the work done on Arabic. However these surveys principally focus on two varieties of Arabic (MSA and AD, written in Arabic letters only), they are slightly old (no such survey since 2015) and therefore do not cover recent resources and tools. To bridge the gap, we propose a survey focusing on 90 recent research papers (74\% of which were published after 2015). Our study presents and classifies the work done on the three varieties of Arabic, by concentrating on both Arabic and Arabizi, and associates each work to its publicly available resources whenever available.},

	abstract = {Inference capabilities of machine learning (ML) systems skyrocketed in recent years, now playing a pivotal role in various aspect of society. The goal in statistical learning is to use data to obtain simple algorithms for predicting a random variable Y from a correlated observation X. Since the dimension of X is typically huge, computationally feasible solutions should summarize it into a lower-dimensional feature vector T , from which Y is predicted. The algorithm will successfully make the prediction if T is a good proxy of Y , despite the said dimensionality-reduction. A myriad of ML algorithms (mostly employing deep learning (DL)) for ﬁnding such representations T based on real-world data are now available. While these methods are often effective in practice, their success is hindered by the lack of a comprehensive theory to explain it. The information bottleneck (IB) theory recently emerged as a bold information-theoretic paradigm for analyzing DL systems. Adopting mutual information as the ﬁgure of merit, it suggests that the best representation T should be maximally informative about Y while minimizing the mutual information with X. In this tutorial we survey the information-theoretic origins of this abstract principle, and its recent impact on DL. For the latter, we cover implications of the IB problem on DL theory, as well as practical algorithms inspired by it. Our goal is to provide a uniﬁed and cohesive description. A clear view of current knowledge is particularly important for further leveraging IB and other information-theoretic ideas to study DL models.},

The result has been a paradigm shift in the community toward revisiting previous ideas and applications in this new framework. Ideas from IT are no exception. One of the ideas which is being revisited by many researchers in this new era, is Information Bottleneck (IB); a formulation of information extraction based on IT. The IB is promising in both analyzing and improving DNNs. The goal of this survey is to review the IB concept and demonstrate its applications in deep learning. The information theoretic nature of IB, makes it also a good candidate in showing the more general concept of how IT can be used in ML. Two important concepts are highlighted in this narrative on the subject, i) the concise and universal view that IT provides on seemingly unrelated methods of ML, demonstrated by explaining how IB relates to minimal suﬃcient statistics, stochastic gradient descent, and variational auto-encoders, and ii) the common technical mistakes and problems caused by applying ideas from IT, which is discussed by a careful study of some recent methods suﬀering from them.},

	abstract = {The information bottleneck is an information theoretic framework, extending the classical notion of minimal sufﬁcient statistics, that ﬁnds concise representations for an ‘input’ random variable that are as relevant as possible for an ‘output’ variable. This framework has been used successfully in various supervised and unsupervised applications. However, its learning theoretic properties and justiﬁcation remained unclear as it differs from standard learning models in several crucial aspects, primarily its explicit reliance on the joint input-output distribution. In practice, an empirical plug-in estimate of the underlying distribution has been used, so far without any ﬁnite sample performance guarantees. In this paper we present several formal results that address these difﬁculties. We prove several non-uniform ﬁnite sample bounds that show that it can provide concise representations with good generalization based on smaller sample sizes than needed to estimate the underlying distribution. Based on these results, we can analyze the information bottleneck method as a learning algorithm in the familiar performance-complexity tradeoff framework. In addition, we formally describe the connection between the information bottleneck and minimal sufﬁcient statistics.},

To establish tractable and scalable objectives, recent work has turned to variational bounds parameterized by neural networks, but the relationships and tradeoffs between these bounds remains unclear. In this work, we unify these recent developments in a single framework. We ﬁnd that the existing variational lower bounds degrade when the MI is large, exhibiting either high bias or high variance. To address this problem, we introduce a continuum of lower bounds that encompasses previous bounds and ﬂexibly trades off bias and variance. On high-dimensional, controlled problems, we empirically characterize the bias and variance of the bounds and their gradients and demonstrate the effectiveness of our new bounds for estimation and representation learning.},

	abstract = {To improve how neural networks function it is crucial to understand their learning process. The information bottleneck theory of deep learning proposes that neural networks achieve good generalization by compressing their representations to disregard information that is not relevant to the task. However, empirical evidence for this theory is conﬂicting, as compression was only observed when networks used saturating activation functions. In contrast, networks with non-saturating activation functions achieved comparable levels of task performance but did not show compression. In this paper we developed more robust mutual information estimation techniques, that adapt to hidden activity of neural networks and produce more sensitive measurements of activations from all functions, especially unbounded functions. Using these adaptive estimation techniques, we explored compression in networks with a range of different activation functions. With two improved methods of estimation, ﬁrstly, we show that saturation of the activation function is not required for compression, and the amount of compression varies between different activation functions. We also ﬁnd that there is a large amount of variation in compression between different network initializations. Secondary, we see that L2 regularization leads to signiﬁcantly increased compression, while preventing overﬁtting. Finally, we show that only compression of the last layer is positively correlated with generalization.},

	abstract = {The Mutual Information (MI) is an often used measure of dependency between two random variables utilized in information theory, statistics and machine learning. Recently several MI estimators have been proposed that can achieve parametric MSE convergence rate. However, most of the previously proposed estimators have the high computational complexity of at least \$O(N{\textasciicircum}2)\$. We propose a unified method for empirical non-parametric estimation of general MI function between random vectors in \${\textbackslash}mathbb\{R\}{\textasciicircum}d\$ based on \$N\$ i.i.d. samples. The reduced complexity MI estimator, called the ensemble dependency graph estimator (EDGE), combines randomized locality sensitive hashing (LSH), dependency graphs, and ensemble bias-reduction methods. We prove that EDGE achieves optimal computational complexity \$O(N)\$, and can achieve the optimal parametric MSE rate of \$O(1/N)\$ if the density is \$d\$ times differentiable. To the best of our knowledge EDGE is the first non-parametric MI estimator that can achieve parametric MSE rates with linear time complexity. We illustrate the utility of EDGE for the analysis of the information plane (IP) in deep learning. Using EDGE we shed light on a controversy on whether or not the compression property of information bottleneck (IB) in fact holds for ReLu and other rectification functions in deep neural networks (DNN).},

	abstract = {High-dimensional statistical learning (HDSL) has wide applications in data analysis, operations research, and decision-making. Despite the availability of multiple theoretical frameworks, most existing HDSL schemes stipulate the following two conditions: (a) the sparsity, and (b) the restricted strong convexity (RSC). This paper generalizes both conditions via the use of the folded concave penalty (FCP). More specifically, we consider an M-estimation problem where (i) the (conventional) sparsity is relaxed into the approximate sparsity and (ii) the RSC is completely absent. We show that the FCP-based regularization leads to poly-logarithmic sample complexity; the training data size is only required to be poly-logarithmic in the problem dimensionality. This finding can facilitate the analysis of two important classes of models that are currently less understood: the high-dimensional nonsmooth learning and the (deep) neural networks (NN). For both problems, we show that the poly-logarithmic sample complexity can be maintained. In particular, our results indicate that the generalizability of NNs under over-parameterization can be theoretically ensured with the aid of regularization.},

Driven by a strong demand for the theoretical explanation of neural networks, some researchers utilize information theory to provide insight into the black box model. However, to the best of our knowledge, employing information theory to quantitatively analyze and qualitatively visualize neural networks has not been extensively studied in the visualization community. In this paper, we combine information entropies and visualization techniques to shed light on how CNN works. Speciﬁcally, we ﬁrst introduce a data model to organize the data that can be extracted from CNN models. Then we propose two ways to calculate entropy under different circumstances. To provide a fundamental understanding of the basic building blocks of CNNs (e.g., convolutional layers, pooling layers, normalization layers) from an information-theoretic perspective, we develop a visual analysis system, CNNSlicer. CNNSlicer allows users to interactively explore the amount of information changes inside the model. With case studies on the widely used benchmark datasets (MNIST and CIFAR-10), we demonstrate the effectiveness of our system in opening the blackbox of CNNs.},

	abstract = {Analyzing deep neural networks (DNNs) via information plane (IP) theory has gained tremendous attention recently as a tool to gain insight into, among others, their generalization ability. However, it is by no means obvious how to estimate mutual information (MI) between each hidden layer and the input/desired output, to construct the IP. For instance, hidden layers with many neurons require MI estimators with robustness towards the high dimensionality associated with such layers. MI estimators should also be able to naturally handle convolutional layers, while at the same time being computationally tractable to scale to large networks. None of the existing IP methods to date have been able to study truly deep Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), such as the e.g. VGG-16. In this paper, we propose an IP analysis using the new matrix–based Re´nyi’s entropy coupled with tensor kernels over convolutional layers, leveraging the power of kernel methods to represent properties of the probability distribution independently of the dimensionality of the data. The obtained results shed new light on the previous literature concerning small-scale DNNs, however using a completely new approach. Importantly, the new framework enables us to provide the ﬁrst comprehensive IP analysis of contemporary large-scale DNNs and CNNs, investigating the different training phases and providing new insights into the training dynamics of largescale neural networks.},

	abstract = {Transfer learning, where a model is first pre-trained on a data-rich task before being fine-tuned on a downstream task, has emerged as a powerful technique in natural language processing (NLP). The effectiveness of transfer learning has given rise to a diversity of approaches, methodology, and practice. In this paper, we explore the landscape of transfer learning techniques for NLP by introducing a unified framework that converts all text-based language problems into a text-to-text format. Our systematic study compares pre-training objectives, architectures, unlabeled data sets, transfer approaches, and other factors on dozens of language understanding tasks. By combining the insights from our exploration with scale and our new ``Colossal Clean Crawled Corpus'', we achieve state-of-the-art results on many benchmarks covering summarization, question answering, text classification, and more. To facilitate future work on transfer learning for NLP, we release our data set, pre-trained models, and code.},

	url = {http://arxiv.org/abs/2006.08962},
	abstract = {It is fundamental to measure model complexity of deep neural networks. The existing literature on model complexity mainly focuses on neural networks with piecewise linear activation functions. Model complexity of neural networks with general curve activation functions remains an open problem. To tackle the challenge, in this paper, we first propose the linear approximation neural network (LANN for short), a piecewise linear framework to approximate a given deep model with curve activation function. LANN constructs individual piecewise linear approximation for the activation function of each neuron, and minimizes the number of linear regions to satisfy a required approximation degree. Then, we analyze the upper bound of the number of linear regions formed by LANNs, and derive the complexity measure based on the upper bound. To examine the usefulness of the complexity measure, we experimentally explore the training process of neural networks and detect overfitting. Our results demonstrate that the occurrence of overfitting is positively correlated with the increase of model complexity during training. We find that the \$L{\textasciicircum}1\$ and \$L{\textasciicircum}2\$ regularizations suppress the increase of model complexity. Finally, we propose two approaches to prevent overfitting by directly constraining model complexity, namely neuron pruning and customized \$L{\textasciicircum}1\$ regularization.},

	abstract = {Deep learning methods have had outstanding performances in various ﬁelds. A fundamental query is why they are so effective. Information theory provides a potential answer by interpreting the learning process as the information transmission and compression of data. The information ﬂows can be visualized on the information plane of the mutual information among the input, hidden, and output layers. In this study, we examine how the information ﬂows are shaped by the network parameters, such as depth, sparsity, weight constraints, and hidden representations. Here, we adopt autoencoders as models of deep learning, because (i) they have clear guidelines for their information ﬂows, and (ii) they have various species, such as vanilla, sparse, tied, variational, and label autoencoders. We measured their information ﬂows using Rényi’s matrix-based α-order entropy functional. As learning progresses, they show a typical ﬁtting phase where the amounts of input-to-hidden and hidden-to-output mutual information both increase. In the last stage of learning, however, some autoencoders show a simplifying phase, previously called the “compression phase”, where input-to-hidden mutual information diminishes. In particular, the sparsity regularization of hidden activities ampliﬁes the simplifying phase. However, tied, variational, and label autoencoders do not have a simplifying phase. Nevertheless, all autoencoders have similar reconstruction errors for training and test data. Thus, the simplifying phase does not seem to be necessary for the generalization of learning.},

	shorttitle = {Triple descent and the two kinds of overfitting},
	url = {http://arxiv.org/abs/2006.03509},
	abstract = {A recent line of research has highlighted the existence of a “double descent” phenomenon in deep learning, whereby increasing the number of training examples N causes the generalization error of neural networks to peak when N is of the same order as the number of parameters P . In earlier works, a similar phenomenon was shown to exist in simpler models such as linear regression, where the peak instead occurs when N is equal to the input dimension D. Since both peaks coincide with the interpolation threshold, they are often conﬂated in the litterature. In this paper, we show that despite their apparent similarity, these two scenarios are inherently different. In fact, both peaks can co-exist when neural networks are applied to noisy regression tasks. The relative size of the peaks is then governed by the degree of nonlinearity of the activation function. Building on recent developments in the analysis of random feature models, we provide a theoretical ground for this sample-wise triple descent. As shown previously, the nonlinear peak at N = P is a true divergence caused by the extreme sensitivity of the output function to both the noise corrupting the labels and the initialization of the random features (or the weights in neural networks). This peak survives in the absence of noise, but can be suppressed by regularization. In contrast, the linear peak at N = D is solely due to overﬁtting the noise in the labels, and forms earlier during training. We show that this peak is implicitly regularized by the nonlinearity, which is why it only becomes salient at high noise and is weakly affected by explicit regularization. Throughout the paper, we compare analytical results obtained in the random feature model with the outcomes of numerical experiments involving deep neural networks.},

	abstract = {1. Summary
In Part I, four ostensibly different theoretical models of induction are presented, in which the problem dealt with is the extrapolation of a very long sequence of symbols—presumably containing all of the information to be used in the induction. Almost all, if not all problems in induction can be put in this form. Some strong heuristic arguments have been obtained for the equivalence of the last three models. One of these models is equivalent to a Bayes formulation, in which a priori probabilities are assigned to sequences of symbols on the basis of the lengths of inputs to a universal Turing machine that are required to produce the sequence of interest as output. Though it seems likely, it is not certain whether the first of the four models is equivalent to the other three. Few rigorous results are presented. Informal investigations are made of the properties of these models. There are discussions of their consistency and meaningfulness, of their degree of independence of the exact nature of the Turing machine used, and of the accuracy of their predictions in comparison to those of other induction methods. In Part II these models are applied to the solution of three problems—prediction of the Bernoulli sequence, extrapolation of a certain kind of Markov chain, and the use of phrase structure grammars for induction. Though some approximations are used, the first of these problems is treated most rigorously. The result is Laplace's rule of succession. The solution to the second problem uses less certain approximations, but the properties of the solution that are discussed, are fairly independent of these approximations. The third application, using phrase structure grammars, is least exact of the three. First a formal solution is presented. Though it appears to have certain deficiencies, it is hoped that presentation of this admittedly inadequate model will suggest acceptable improvements in it. This formal solution is then applied in an approximate way to the determination of the “optimum” phrase structure grammar for a given set of strings. The results that are obtained are plausible, but subject to the uncertainties of the approximation used.},

	abstract = {We define the relevant information in a signal \$x{\textbackslash}in X\$ as being the information that this signal provides about another signal \$y{\textbackslash}in {\textbackslash}Y\$. Examples include the information that face images provide about the names of the people portrayed, or the information that speech sounds provide about the words spoken. Understanding the signal \$x\$ requires more than just predicting \$y\$, it also requires specifying which features of \${\textbackslash}X\$ play a role in the prediction. We formalize this problem as that of finding a short code for \${\textbackslash}X\$ that preserves the maximum information about \${\textbackslash}Y\$. That is, we squeeze the information that \${\textbackslash}X\$ provides about \${\textbackslash}Y\$ through a `bottleneck' formed by a limited set of codewords \${\textbackslash}tX\$. This constrained optimization problem can be seen as a generalization of rate distortion theory in which the distortion measure \$d(x,{\textbackslash}x)\$ emerges from the joint statistics of \${\textbackslash}X\$ and \${\textbackslash}Y\$. This approach yields an exact set of self consistent equations for the coding rules \$X {\textbackslash}to {\textbackslash}tX\$ and \${\textbackslash}tX {\textbackslash}to {\textbackslash}Y\$. Solutions to these equations can be found by a convergent re-estimation method that generalizes the Blahut-Arimoto algorithm. Our variational principle provides a surprisingly rich framework for discussing a variety of problems in signal processing and learning, as will be described in detail elsewhere.},

	abstract = {The success of neural networks on a diverse set of NLP tasks has led researchers to question how much these networks actually ``know'' about natural language. Probes are a natural way of assessing this. When probing, a researcher chooses a linguistic task and trains a supervised model to predict annotations in that linguistic task from the network's learned representations. If the probe does well, the researcher may conclude that the representations encode knowledge related to the task. A commonly held belief is that using simpler models as probes is better; the logic is that simpler models will identify linguistic structure, but not learn the task itself. We propose an information-theoretic operationalization of probing as estimating mutual information that contradicts this received wisdom: one should always select the highest performing probe one can, even if it is more complex, since it will result in a tighter estimate, and thus reveal more of the linguistic information inherent in the representation. The experimental portion of our paper focuses on empirically estimating the mutual information between a linguistic property and BERT, comparing these estimates to several baselines. We evaluate on a set of ten typologically diverse languages often underrepresented in NLP research---plus English---totalling eleven languages.},

However, hard attention is a restrictive assumption, which may complicate the relevance of these results for practical transformers. In this work, we analyze the circuit complexity of transformers with saturated attention: a generalization of hard attention that more closely captures the attention patterns learnable in practical transformers. We show that saturated transformers transcend the limitations of hard-attention transformers. With some minor assumptions, we prove that the number of bits needed to represent a saturated transformer memory vector is O(log n), which implies saturated transformers can be simulated by log-depth circuits. Thus, the jump from hard to saturated attention can be understood as increasing the transformer’s effective circuit depth by a factor of O(log n).},

	abstract = {The practical successes of deep neural networks have not been matched by theoretical progress that satisfyingly explains their behavior. In this work, we study the information bottleneck (IB) theory of deep learning, which makes three speciﬁc claims: ﬁrst, that deep networks undergo two distinct phases consisting of an initial ﬁtting phase and a subsequent compression phase; second, that the compression phase is causally related to the excellent generalization performance of deep networks; and third, that the compression phase occurs due to the diffusion-like behavior of stochastic gradient descent. Here we show that none of these claims hold true in the general case. Through a combination of analytical results and simulation, we demonstrate that the information plane trajectory is predominantly a function of the neural nonlinearity employed: double-sided saturating nonlinearities like tanh yield a compression phase as neural activations enter the saturation regime, but linear activation functions and single-sided saturating nonlinearities like the widely used ReLU in fact do not. Moreover, we ﬁnd that there is no evident causal connection between compression and generalization: networks that do not compress are still capable of generalization, and vice versa. Next, we show that the compression phase, when it exists, does not arise from stochasticity in training by demonstrating that we can replicate the IB ﬁndings using full batch gradient descent rather than stochastic gradient descent. Finally, we show that when an input domain consists of a subset of task-relevant and task-irrelevant information, hidden representations do compress the task-irrelevant information, although the overall information about the input may monotonically increase with training time, and that this compression happens concurrently with the ﬁtting process rather than during a subsequent compression period.},

	url = {http://arxiv.org/abs/2111.11432},
	abstract = {Automated visual understanding of our diverse and open world demands computer vision models to generalize well with minimal customization for specific tasks, similar to human vision. Computer vision foundation models, which are trained on diverse, large-scale dataset and can be adapted to a wide range of downstream tasks, are critical for this mission to solve real-world computer vision applications. While existing vision foundation models such as CLIP, ALIGN, and Wu Dao 2.0 focus mainly on mapping images and textual representations to a cross-modal shared representation, we introduce a new computer vision foundation model, Florence, to expand the representations from coarse (scene) to fine (object), from static (images) to dynamic (videos), and from RGB to multiple modalities (caption, depth). By incorporating universal visual-language representations from Web-scale image-text data, our Florence model can be easily adapted for various computer vision tasks, such as classification, retrieval, object detection, VQA, image caption, video retrieval and action recognition. Moreover, Florence demonstrates outstanding performance in many types of transfer learning: fully sampled fine-tuning, linear probing, few-shot transfer and zero-shot transfer for novel images and objects. All of these properties are critical for our vision foundation model to serve general purpose vision tasks. Florence achieves new state-of-the-art results in majority of 44 representative benchmarks, e.g., ImageNet-1K zero-shot classification with top-1 accuracy of 83.74 and the top-5 accuracy of 97.18, 62.4 mAP on COCO fine tuning, 80.36 on VQA, and 87.8 on Kinetics-600.},

	title = {Efficiently {Modeling} {Long} {Sequences} with {Structured} {State} {Spaces}},
	url = {http://arxiv.org/abs/2111.00396},
	abstract = {A central goal of sequence modeling is designing a single principled model that can address sequence data across a range of modalities and tasks, particularly on long-range dependencies. Although conventional models including RNNs, CNNs, and Transformers have specialized variants for capturing long dependencies, they still struggle to scale to very long sequences of \$10000\$ or more steps. A promising recent approach proposed modeling sequences by simulating the fundamental state space model (SSM) {\textbackslash}( x'(t) = Ax(t) + Bu(t), y(t) = Cx(t) + Du(t) {\textbackslash}), and showed that for appropriate choices of the state matrix {\textbackslash}( A {\textbackslash}), this system could handle long-range dependencies mathematically and empirically. However, this method has prohibitive computation and memory requirements, rendering it infeasible as a general sequence modeling solution. We propose the Structured State Space (S4) sequence model based on a new parameterization for the SSM, and show that it can be computed much more efficiently than prior approaches while preserving their theoretical strengths. Our technique involves conditioning {\textbackslash}( A {\textbackslash}) with a low-rank correction, allowing it to be diagonalized stably and reducing the SSM to the well-studied computation of a Cauchy kernel. S4 achieves strong empirical results across a diverse range of established benchmarks, including (i) 91{\textbackslash}\% accuracy on sequential CIFAR-10 with no data augmentation or auxiliary losses, on par with a larger 2-D ResNet, (ii) substantially closing the gap to Transformers on image and language modeling tasks, while performing generation \$60{\textbackslash}times\$ faster (iii) SoTA on every task from the Long Range Arena benchmark, including solving the challenging Path-X task of length 16k that all prior work fails on, while being as efficient as all competitors.},

	abstract = {ML models often exhibit unexpectedly poor behavior when they are deployed in real-world domains. We identify underspeciﬁcation as a key reason for these failures. An ML pipeline is underspeciﬁed when it can return many predictors with equivalently strong held-out performance in the training domain. Underspeciﬁcation is common in modern ML pipelines, such as those based on deep learning. Predictors returned by underspeciﬁed pipelines are often treated as equivalent based on their training domain performance, but we show here that such predictors can behave very diﬀerently in deployment domains. This ambiguity can lead to instability and poor model behavior in practice, and is a distinct failure mode from previously identiﬁed issues arising from structural mismatch between training and deployment domains. We show that this problem appears in a wide variety of practical ML pipelines, using examples from computer vision, medical imaging, natural language processing, clinical risk prediction based on electronic health records, and medical genomics. Our results show the need to explicitly account for underspeciﬁcation in modeling pipelines that are intended for real-world deployment in any domain.},

Although previous studies have compared small samples of informal and formal results, this article presents the first large-scale comparison based on a random sample of phenomena from a leading theoretical journal (Linguistic Inquiry). We tested 296 data points from the approximately 1743 English data points that were published in Linguistic Inquiry between 2001 and 2010. We tested this sample with 936 naïve participants using three formal judgment tasks (magnitude estimation, 7-point Likert scale, and two-alternative forced-choice) and report five statistical analyses. The results suggest a convergence rate of 95\% between informal and formal methods, with a margin of error of 5.3--5.8\%. We discuss the implications of this convergence rate for the ongoing conversation about judgment collection methods, and lay out a set of questions for future research into syntactic methodology.},

To identify how the brain continuously represents and updates speech units, we recorded two-hour magnetoencephalograms from 21 subjects listening to short narratives. Our encoding and decoding analyses show that the human brain uses a dynamic coding scheme to represent approximately three successive phonetic features at each time sample. These dynamic phonetic representations, not directly accessible from the acoustic signal, are active earlier when phonemes are more predictable, and are sustained when lexical identity is uncertain. The results reveal how phoneme sequences in natural speech are neurally represented and shed new light on how the human brain combines them to probe the mental lexicon.},

This study examines how sentence processing is affected by readers’ uncertainty about those expectations. In a self-paced reading study, we use lexical subcategorization distributions to factorially manipulate both the strength of expectations and the uncertainty about them. We compare two types of uncertainty: uncertainty about the verb’s complement, reﬂecting the next prediction step; and uncertainty about the full sentence, reﬂecting an unbounded number of prediction steps. We ﬁnd that uncertainty about the full structure, but not about the next step, was a signiﬁcant predictor of processing difﬁculty: Greater reduction in uncertainty was correlated with increased reading times (RTs). We additionally replicated previously observed effects of expectation violation (surprisal), orthogonal to the effect of uncertainty. This suggests that both surprisal and uncertainty affect human RTs. We discuss the consequences for theories of sentence comprehension.},

In Experiment 2, we tested a novel hypothesis that children would comprehend novel verbs in, and generalize them to, the double object frame if they were ﬁrst familiarized to the verbs in the prepositional frame. They did, suggesting that part of their difﬁculty with the double object frame is due to uncertainty about a new verb’s semantic/syntactic properties, information that the easy-to-comprehend prepositional frame provides. The beneﬁts of training were shortlived, however; children again struggled after a 2-h delay. The results are discussed in the context of mechanisms underlying verb acquisition.},

We ﬁrst show that any DNN can be quantiﬁed by the mutual information between the layers and the input and output variables. Using this representation we can calculate the optimal information theoretic limits of the DNN and obtain ﬁnite sample generalization bounds. The advantage of getting closer to the theoretical limit is quantiﬁable both by the generalization bound and by the network’s simplicity. We argue that both the optimal architecture, number of layers and features/connections at each layer, are related to the bifurcation points of the information bottleneck tradeoff, namely, relevant compression of the input layer with respect to the output layer. The hierarchical representations at the layered network naturally correspond to the structural phase transitions along the information curve. We believe that this new insight can lead to new optimality bounds and deep learning algorithms.},

Models that condition predictions on a concise rationale, while being more interpretable, tend to be less accurate than models that are able to use the entire context. In this paper, we show that it is possible to better manage the trade-off between concise explanations and high task accuracy by optimizing a bound on the Information Bottleneck (IB) objective. Our approach jointly learns an explainer that predicts sparse binary masks over input sentences without explicit supervision, and an end-task predictor that considers only the residual sentences. Using IB, we derive a learning objective that allows direct control of mask sparsity levels through a tunable sparse prior. Experiments on the ERASER benchmark demonstrate significant gains over previous work for both task performance and agreement with human rationales. Furthermore, we find that in the semi-supervised setting, a modest amount of gold rationales (25\% of training examples with gold masks) can close the performance gap with a model that uses the full input.},

However, ranking by string probability can be problematic due to surface form competition—wherein different surface forms compete for probability mass, even if they represent the same underlying concept in a given context, e.g. “computer” and “PC.” Since probability mass is finite, this lowers the probability of the correct answer, due to competition from other strings that are valid answers (but not one of the multiple choice options). We introduce Domain Conditional Pointwise Mutual Information, an alternative scoring function that directly compensates for surface form competition by simply reweighing each option according to its a priori likelihood within the context of a specific task. It achieves consistent gains in zero-shot performance over both calibrated and uncalibrated scoring functions on all GPT-2 and GPT-3 models on a variety of multiple choice datasets.},

	abstract = {The capacity of neural networks like the widely adopted transformer is known to be very high. Evidence is emerging that they learn successfully due to inductive bias in the training routine, typically a variant of gradient descent (GD). To better understand this bias, we study the tendency for transformer parameters to grow in magnitude ( 2 norm) during training, and its implications for the emergent representations within self attention layers. Empirically, we document norm growth in the training of transformer language models, including T5 during its pretraining. As the parameters grow in magnitude, we prove that the network approximates a discretized network with saturated activation functions. Such “saturated” networks are known to have a reduced capacity compared to the full network family that can be described in terms of formal languages and automata. Our results suggest saturation is a new characterization of an inductive bias implicit in GD of particular interest for NLP. We leverage the emergent discrete structure in a saturated transformer to analyze the role of different attention heads, ﬁnding that some focus locally on a small number of positions, while other heads compute global averages, allowing counting. We believe understanding the interplay between these two capabilities may shed further light on the structure of computation within large transformers.},

	url = {http://arxiv.org/abs/1806.07572},
	abstract = {At initialization, artificial neural networks (ANNs) are equivalent to Gaussian processes in the infinite-width limit, thus connecting them to kernel methods. We prove that the evolution of an ANN during training can also be described by a kernel: during gradient descent on the parameters of an ANN, the network function \$f\_{\textbackslash}theta\$ (which maps input vectors to output vectors) follows the kernel gradient of the functional cost (which is convex, in contrast to the parameter cost) w.r.t. a new kernel: the Neural Tangent Kernel (NTK). This kernel is central to describe the generalization features of ANNs. While the NTK is random at initialization and varies during training, in the infinite-width limit it converges to an explicit limiting kernel and it stays constant during training. This makes it possible to study the training of ANNs in function space instead of parameter space. Convergence of the training can then be related to the positive-definiteness of the limiting NTK. We prove the positive-definiteness of the limiting NTK when the data is supported on the sphere and the non-linearity is non-polynomial. We then focus on the setting of least-squares regression and show that in the infinite-width limit, the network function \$f\_{\textbackslash}theta\$ follows a linear differential equation during training. The convergence is fastest along the largest kernel principal components of the input data with respect to the NTK, hence suggesting a theoretical motivation for early stopping. Finally we study the NTK numerically, observe its behavior for wide networks, and compare it to the infinite-width limit.},

For an \$m\$ hidden node shallow neural network with ReLU activation and \$n\$ training data, we show as long as \$m\$ is large enough and no two inputs are parallel, randomly initialized gradient descent converges to a globally optimal solution at a linear convergence rate for the quadratic loss function. Our analysis relies on the following observation: over-parameterization and random initialization jointly restrict every weight vector to be close to its initialization for all iterations, which allows us to exploit a strong convexity-like property to show that gradient descent converges at a global linear rate to the global optimum. We believe these insights are also useful in analyzing deep models and other first order methods.},

In this setting, questions about data efﬁciency, memorization, generalization, and speed of learning can be studied in great detail. In some situations we show that neural networks learn through a process of “grokking” a pattern in the data, improving generalization performance from random chance level to perfect generalization, and that this improvement in generalization can happen well past the point of overﬁtting. We also study generalization as a function of dataset size and ﬁnd that smaller datasets require increasing amounts of optimization for generalization. We argue that these datasets provide a fertile ground for studying a poorly understood aspect of deep learning: generalization of overparametrized neural networks beyond memorization of the ﬁnite training dataset.},

	url = {http://arxiv.org/abs/1904.11955},
	abstract = {How well does a classic deep net architecture like AlexNet or VGG19 classify on a standard dataset such as CIFAR-10 when its width --- namely, number of channels in convolutional layers, and number of nodes in fully-connected internal layers --- is allowed to increase to infinity? Such questions have come to the forefront in the quest to theoretically understand deep learning and its mysteries about optimization and generalization. They also connect deep learning to notions such as Gaussian processes and kernels. A recent paper [Jacot et al., 2018] introduced the Neural Tangent Kernel (NTK) which captures the behavior of fully-connected deep nets in the infinite width limit trained by gradient descent; this object was implicit in some other recent papers. An attraction of such ideas is that a pure kernel-based method is used to capture the power of a fully-trained deep net of infinite width. The current paper gives the first efficient exact algorithm for computing the extension of NTK to convolutional neural nets, which we call Convolutional NTK (CNTK), as well as an efficient GPU implementation of this algorithm. This results in a significant new benchmark for the performance of a pure kernel-based method on CIFAR-10, being \$10{\textbackslash}\%\$ higher than the methods reported in [Novak et al., 2019], and only \$6{\textbackslash}\%\$ lower than the performance of the corresponding finite deep net architecture (once batch normalization, etc. are turned off). Theoretically, we also give the first non-asymptotic proof showing that a fully-trained sufficiently wide net is indeed equivalent to the kernel regression predictor using NTK.},

Moreover, we show that double descent occurs not just as a function of model size, but also as a function of the number of training epochs. We unify the above phenomena by defining a new complexity measure we call the effective model complexity and conjecture a generalized double descent with respect to this measure. Furthermore, our notion of model complexity allows us to identify certain regimes where increasing (even quadrupling) the number of train samples actually hurts test performance.},

	abstract = {The role of language in mediating or augmenting human thought is the subject of longstanding debate. One specific claim links language and the ability to categorize objects based on a certain feature. According to this view, language resources are critical for feature-based categorization because verbal labels can help maintain focus on the relevant categorization criterion and reduce interference from other (irrelevant) features. As a result, language impairment is expected to affect categorization of items grouped according to a single feature (low-dimensional categories, e.g., ‘Things made of wood’), where many irrelevant features need to be inhibited, more than categorization of items that share many features (highdimensional categories, e.g., ‘Animals’), where few irrelevant features need to be inhibited. We here present findings from individuals with aphasia that go against this hypothesis (Experiments 1 and 2). We also present fMRI data from young healthy adults, showing that the language brain regions exhibit low activity level during categorization, for both lowdimensional and high-dimensional categories (Experiment 3). In tandem, these results demonstrate that language is not critical for object categorization. Our work contributes to the growing evidence that, although language may assist in accessing task-relevant information (e.g., instructions), many cognitive tasks in adult brains proceed without recruiting the language system.},

Furthermore, a tighter integration of computing and network is appealing, as it overcomes traditional bottlenecks between CPUs and network interfaces, and dramatically reduces latency.
            In this article, we present the design of a novel hash table, a fundamental building block used in many applications, to enable data processing on FPGAs close to the network. We present a fully pipelined design capable of sustaining consistent 10Gbps line-rate processing by deploying a concurrent mechanism to handle hash collisions. We address additional design challenges such as support for a broad range of key sizes without stalling the pipeline through careful matching of lookup time with packet reception time. Finally, the design is based on a scalable architecture that can be easily parameterized to work with different memory types operating at different access speeds and latencies.
            We have tested the proposed hash table in an FPGA-based memcached appliance implementing a main-memory key-value store in hardware. The hash table is used to index 2 million entries in 24GB of external DDR3 DRAM while sustaining 13 million requests per second, the maximum packet rate that can be achieved with UDP packets on a 10Gbps link for this application.},

To demonstrate our method we consider a ﬁne-grained image classiﬁcation task in which we take as input an image and a counterfactual class and output text which explains why the image does not belong to a counterfactual class. We then analyze our generated counterfactual explanations both qualitatively and quantitatively using proposed automatic metrics.},

	url = {http://arxiv.org/abs/2110.06674},
	abstract = {In many contexts, lying -- the use of verbal falsehoods to deceive -- is harmful. While lying has traditionally been a human affair, AI systems that make sophisticated verbal statements are becoming increasingly prevalent. This raises the question of how we should limit the harm caused by AI "lies" (i.e. falsehoods that are actively selected for). Human truthfulness is governed by social norms and by laws (against defamation, perjury, and fraud). Differences between AI and humans present an opportunity to have more precise standards of truthfulness for AI, and to have these standards rise over time. This could provide significant benefits to public epistemics and the economy, and mitigate risks of worst-case AI futures. Establishing norms or laws of AI truthfulness will require significant work to: (1) identify clear truthfulness standards; (2) create institutions that can judge adherence to those standards; and (3) develop AI systems that are robustly truthful. Our initial proposals for these areas include: (1) a standard of avoiding "negligent falsehoods" (a generalisation of lies that is easier to assess); (2) institutions to evaluate AI systems before and after real-world deployment; and (3) explicitly training AI systems to be truthful via curated datasets and human interaction. A concerning possibility is that evaluation mechanisms for eventual truthfulness standards could be captured by political interests, leading to harmful censorship and propaganda. Avoiding this might take careful attention. And since the scale of AI speech acts might grow dramatically over the coming decades, early truthfulness standards might be particularly important because of the precedents they set.},

We study various types of architectures with multiple components - retrievers, rankers, and encoder-decoders - with the goal of maximizing knowledgeability while retaining conversational ability. We demonstrate that our best models obtain state-of-the-art performance on two knowledge-grounded conversational tasks. The models exhibit open-domain conversational capabilities, generalize effectively to scenarios not within the training data, and, as verified by human evaluations, substantially reduce the well-known problem of knowledge hallucination in state-of-the-art chatbots.},

The benchmark comprises 817 questions that span 38 categories, including health, law, ﬁnance and politics. We crafted questions that some humans would answer falsely due to a false belief or misconception. To perform well, models must avoid generating false answers learned from imitating human texts. We tested GPT-3, GPT-Neo/J, GPT-2 and a T5-based model. The best model was truthful on 58\% of questions, while human performance was 94\%. Models generated many false answers that mimic popular misconceptions and have the potential to deceive humans. The largest models were generally the least truthful. For example, the 6B-parameter GPT-J model was 17\% less truthful than its 125M-parameter counterpart. This contrasts with other NLP tasks, where performance improves with model size. However, this result is expected if false answers are learned from the training distribution. We suggest that scaling up models alone is less promising for improving truthfulness than ﬁne-tuning using training objectives other than imitation of text from the web.},

In this paper, we present the first exhaustive analysis of the text organization of human speech. Two important results are that: (i) the construction and organization of spoken language can be characterized as Zipf's law and Heaps' law, as observed in written texts; (ii) word frequency vs. rank distribution and the growth of distinct words with the increase of text length shows significant differences between book and speech. In speech word frequency distribution are more concentrated on higher frequency words, and the emergence of new words decreases much rapidly when the content length grows.

	url = {http://arxiv.org/abs/2106.09488},
	abstract = {There is a recent trend in machine learning to increase model quality by growing models to sizes previously thought to be unreasonable. Recent work has shown that autoregressive generative models with cross-entropy objective functions exhibit smooth power-law relationships, or scaling laws, that predict model quality from model size, training set size, and the available compute budget. These scaling laws allow one to choose nearly optimal hyper-parameters given constraints on available training data, model parameter count, or training computation budget. In this paper, we demonstrate that acoustic models trained with an auto-predictive coding loss behave as if they are subject to similar scaling laws. We extend previous work to jointly predict loss due to model size, to training set size, and to the inherent "irreducible loss" of the task. We find that the scaling laws accurately match model performance over two orders of magnitude in both model size and training set size, and make predictions about the limits of model performance.},

	abstract = {The success of deep learning in vision can be attributed to: (a) models with high capacity; (b) increased computational power; and (c) availability of large-scale labeled data. Since 2012, there have been significant advances in representation capabilities of the models and computational capabilities of GPUs. But the size of the biggest dataset has surprisingly remained constant. What will happen if we increase the dataset size by 10x or 100x? This paper takes a step towards clearing the clouds of mystery surrounding the relationship between `enormous data' and visual deep learning. By exploiting the JFT-300M dataset which has more than 375M noisy labels for 300M images, we investigate how the performance of current vision tasks would change if this data was used for representation learning. Our paper delivers some surprising (and some expected) findings. First, we find that the performance on vision tasks increases logarithmically based on volume of training data size. Second, we show that representation learning (or pre-training) still holds a lot of promise. One can improve performance on many vision tasks by just training a better base model. Finally, as expected, we present new state-of-the-art results for different vision tasks including image classification, object detection, semantic segmentation and human pose estimation. Our sincere hope is that this inspires vision community to not undervalue the data and develop collective efforts in building larger datasets.},

	abstract = {Deep learning (DL) creates impactful advances following a virtuous recipe: model architecture search, creating large training data sets, and scaling computation. It is widely believed that growing training sets and models should improve accuracy and result in better products. As DL application domains grow, we would like a deeper understanding of the relationships between training set size, computational scale, and model accuracy improvements to advance the state-of-the-art. This paper presents a large scale empirical characterization of generalization error and model size growth as training sets grow. We introduce a methodology for this measurement and test four machine learning domains: machine translation, language modeling, image processing, and speech recognition. Our empirical results show power-law generalization error scaling across a breadth of factors, resulting in power-law exponents---the "steepness" of the learning curve---yet to be explained by theoretical work. Further, model improvements only shift the error but do not appear to affect the power-law exponent. We also show that model size scales sublinearly with data size. These scaling relationships have significant implications on deep learning research, practice, and systems. They can assist model debugging, setting accuracy targets, and decisions about data set growth. They can also guide computing system design and underscore the importance of continued computational scaling.},

We present a large-scale experimental comparison of logistic regression and tree induction, assessing classiﬁcation accuracy and the quality of rankings based on classmembership probabilities. We use a learning-curve analysis to examine the relationship of these measures to the size of the training set. The results of the study show several things. (1) Contrary to some prior observations, logistic regression does not generally outperform tree induction. (2) More speciﬁcally, and not surprisingly, logistic regression is better for smaller training sets and tree induction for larger data sets. Importantly, this often holds for training sets drawn from the same domain (that is, the learning curves cross), so conclusions about induction-algorithm superiority on a given domain must be based on an analysis of the learning curves. (3) Contrary to conventional wisdom, tree induction is effective at producing probability-based rankings, although apparently comparatively less so for a given training-set size than at making classiﬁcations. Finally, (4) the domains on which tree induction and logistic regression are ultimately preferable can be characterized surprisingly well by a simple measure of the separability of signal from noise.},

This system is presently stressed by a fast pace of technological change, by an increasingly aggressive, competitive environment, and by changing regulatory practices and public pressure. Traditionally, each level of this is studied separately by a particular academic discipline, and modelling is done by generalising across systems and their particular hazard sources. It is argued that risk management must be modelled by cross-disciplinary studies, considering risk management to be a control problem and serving to represent the control structure involving all levels of society for each particular hazard category.},

However, little is known about the overall architecture of this representational system, including the role played by higher level areas that integrate different types of sensory and motor information. The present study addressed this issue by investigating the simultaneous contributions of multiple sensory-motor modalities to semantic word processing. With a multivariate fMRI design, we examined activation associated with 5 sensory-motor attributes—color, shape, visual motion, sound, and manipulation—for 900 words. Regions responsive to each attribute were identiﬁed using independent ratings of the attributes’ relevance to the meaning of each word. The results indicate that these aspects of conceptual knowledge are encoded in multimodal and higher level unimodal areas involved in processing the corresponding types of information during perception and action, in agreement with embodied theories of semantics. They also reveal a hierarchical system of abstracted sensorymotor representations incorporating a major division between object interaction and object perception processes.},

	abstract = {The dispute of how the human brain represents conceptual knowledge has been argued in many scientiﬁc ﬁelds. Brain imaging studies have shown that the spatial patterns of neural activation in the brain are correlated with thinking about different semantic categories of words (for example, tools, animals, and buildings) or when viewing the related pictures. In this paper, we present a computational model that learns to predict the neural activation captured in functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data of test words. Unlike the models with hand-crafted features that have been used in the literature, in this paper we propose a novel approach wherein decoding models are built with features extracted from popular linguistic encodings of Word2Vec, GloVe, Meta-Embeddings in conjunction with the empirical fMRI data associated with viewing several dozen concrete nouns. We compared these models with several other models that use word features extracted from FastText, Randomly-generated features, Mitchell’s 25 features [1]. The experimental results show that the predicted fMRI images using Meta-Embeddings meet the state-of-the-art performance. Although models with features from GloVe and Word2Vec predict fMRI images similar to the state-of-the-art model, model with features from Meta-Embeddings predicts signiﬁcantly better. The proposed scheme that uses popular linguistic encoding offers a simple and easy approach for semantic decoding from fMRI experiments.},

We argue most current benchmarks fail at these criteria, and that adversarial data collection does not meaningfully address the causes of these failures.

A slow memory allocator can bottleneck the entire application stack, while an unsecure memory allocator can render applications inconsistent upon program bugs or system failure. Unlike DRAM-based memory allocators, it is indispensable for an NVMM allocator to guarantee its heap metadata safety from both internal and external errors. An effective NVMM memory allocator should be 1) safe, 2) scalable, and 3) high performing. Unfortunately, none of the existing persistent memory allocators achieve all three requisites. For example, we found that even Intel's de-facto NVMM allocator-libpmemobj is vulnerable to silent data corruption and persistent memory leaks resulting from a simple heap overflow. In this paper, we propose Poseidon, a safe, fast, and scalable persistent memory allocator. The premise of Poseidon revolves around providing a user application with per-CPU sub-heaps for scalability and high performance, while managing the heap metadata in a segregated fashion and efficiently protecting the metadata using a scalable hardware-based protection scheme, Intel's Memory Protection Keys (MPK). We evaluate Poseidon with a wide array of microbenchmarks and real-world benchmarks, noting: Poseidon outperforms the state-of-art allocators by a significant margin, showing improved scalability and performance, while also guaranteeing heap metadata protection.},

With the recognition results, a natural language understanding system classifies the text to structured data as domain, intent and slots for down-streaming consumers, such as dialog system, hands-free applications. These components are usually developed and optimized independently. In this paper, we present our study on an end-to-end learning system for spoken language understanding. With this unified approach, we can infer the semantic meaning directly from audio features without the intermediate text representation.

	abstract = {Machine learning (ML) systems are rapidly increasing in size, are acquiring new capabilities, and are increasingly deployed in high-stakes settings. As with other powerful technologies, safety for ML should be a leading research priority. In response to emerging safety challenges in ML, such as those introduced by recent large-scale models, we provide a new roadmap for ML Safety and reﬁne the technical problems that the ﬁeld needs to address. We present four problems ready for research, namely withstanding hazards (“Robustness”), identifying hazards (“Monitoring”), steering ML systems (“Alignment”), and reducing risks to how ML systems are handled (“External Safety”). Throughout, we clarify each problem’s motivation and provide concrete research directions.},

The ﬁrst, the orthogonality thesis, holds (with some caveats) that intelligence and ﬁnal goals (purposes) are orthogonal axes along which possible artiﬁcial intellects can freely vary—more or less any level of intelligence could be combined with more or less any ﬁnal goal. The second, the instrumental convergence thesis, holds that as long as they possess a sufﬁcient level of intelligence, agents having any of a wide range of ﬁnal goals will pursue similar intermediary goals because they have instrumental reasons to do so. In combination, the two theses help us understand the possible range of behavior of superintelligent agents, and they point to some potential dangers in building such an agent.},

First, under what circumstances will learned models be optimizers, including when they should not be? Second, when a learned model is an optimizer, what will its objective be - how will it differ from the loss function it was trained under - and how can it be aligned?

Among the key concepts drawn are that components of spoken language are continuous between species, and that the vocal learning component is the most specialized and rarest and evolved by brain pathway duplication from an ancient motor learning pathway. These concepts have important implications for understanding brain mechanisms and disorders of spoken language.},

Both birdsong and spoken language are culturally transmitted across generations, within species-specific constraints that leave room for considerable variation. We review the commonalities and differences between vocal learning bird species and humans, across behavioral, developmental, neuroanatomical, physiological, and genetic levels. We propose that cultural transmission of vocal repertoires is a natural consequence of the evolution of vocal learning and that at least some species-specific universals, as well as species differences in cultural transmission, are due to differences in vocal learning phenotypes, which are shaped by genetic constraints. We suggest that it is the balance between these constraints and features of the social environment that allows cultural learning to propagate. We describe new opportunities for exploring meaningful comparisons of birdsong and human vocal culture.},

Robert Nichols develops the concept of "recursive dispossession" to describe the critical bind that indigenous activists face when seeking justice for the appropriation of their land: they simultaneously claim that their land was stolen by Anglo settlers, but also that territoriality and property ownership are themselves settler concepts. Putting indigenous thought into conversation with Marxist theory, Nichols argues that property relations under settler colonialism are built upon a structural form of negation, wherein some groups must be alienated from the very property that is being created. Thus, theft precedes and generates property, rather than vice versa, and indigenous claims of retroactive "original ownership" are not contradictory or logically flawed, but rather, gesture back to this very dynamic. By looking at dispossession as a unique historical process in the context of colonialism, Nichols shows how contemporary indigenous struggles have always already produced their own mode of critique and articulation of radical politics"--},

BERT, its variants, GPT-2/3, and others, most recently Switch-C, have pushed the boundaries of the possible both through architectural innovations and through sheer size. Using these pretrained models and the methodology of fine-tuning them for specific tasks, researchers have extended the state of the art on a wide array of tasks as measured by leaderboards on specific benchmarks for English. In this paper, we take a step back and ask: How big is too big? What are the possible risks associated with this technology and what paths are available for mitigating those risks? We provide recommendations including weighing the environmental and financial costs first, investing resources into curating and carefully documenting datasets rather than ingesting everything on the web, carrying out pre-development exercises evaluating how the planned approach fits into research and development goals and supports stakeholder values, and encouraging research directions beyond ever larger language models.},

This shift has been fueled by recent advances in hardware and techniques enabling remarkable levels of computation, resulting in impressive advances in AI across many applications. However, the massive computation required to obtain these exciting results is costly both ﬁnancially, due to the price of specialized hardware and electricity or cloud compute time, and to the environment, as a result of non-renewable energy used to fuel modern tensor processing hardware. In a paper published this year at ACL, we brought this issue to the attention of NLP researchers by quantifying the approximate ﬁnancial and environmental costs of training and tuning neural network models for NLP (Strubell, Ganesh, and McCallum 2019). In this extended abstract, we brieﬂy summarize our ﬁndings in NLP, incorporating updated estimates and broader information from recent related publications, and provide actionable recommendations to reduce costs and improve equity in the machine learning and artiﬁcial intelligence community.},

	abstract = {All AI models are susceptible to learning biases in data that they are trained on. For generative dialogue models, being trained on real human conversations containing unbalanced gender and race/ethnicity references can lead to models that display learned biases, which we deﬁne here broadly as any measurable differences in the distributions of words or semantic content of conversations based on demographic groups. We measure the strength of such biases by producing artiﬁcial conversations between two copies of a dialogue model, conditioning one conversational partner to state a name commonly associated with a certain gender and/or race/ethnicity. We ﬁnd that larger capacity models tend to exhibit more gender bias and greater stereotyping of occupations by gender. We show that several methods of tuning these dialogue models, specifically name scrambling, controlled generation, and unlikelihood training, are effective in reducing bias in conversation, including on a downstream conversational task. Name scrambling is also effective in lowering differences in token usage across conversations where partners have names associated with different genders or races/ethnicities.},

	abstract = {Language is thought to represent one of the most complex cognitive functions in humans. Here we break down complexity of language to its most basic syntactic computation which hierarchically binds single words together to form larger phrases and sentences. So far, the neural implementation of this basic operation has only been inferred indirectly from studies investigating more complex linguistic phenomena. In the present sub-region based functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) study we directly assessed the neuroanatomical nature of this process. Our results showed that syntactic phrases—compared to word-list sequences—corresponded to increased neural activity in the ventral-anterior portion of the left pars opercularis [Brodmann Area (BA) 44], whereas the adjacently located deep frontal operculum/anterior insula (FOP/aINS), a phylogenetically older and less specialized region, was found to be equally active for both conditions. Crucially, the functional activity of syntactic binding was conﬁned to one out of ﬁve clusters proposed by a recent ﬁne-grained sub-anatomical parcellation for BA 44, with consistency across individuals. Neuroanatomically, the present results call for a redeﬁnition of BA 44 as a region with internal functional specializations. Neurocomputationally, they support the idea of invariance within BA 44 in the location of activation across participants for basic syntactic building processing.},

	abstract = {Minimalist grammars (MGs) and multiple context-free grammars (MCFGs) are weakly equivalent in the sense that they deﬁne the same languages, a large mildly context-sensitive class that properly includes context-free languages. But in addition, for each MG, there is an MCFG which is strongly equivalent in the sense that it deﬁnes the same language with isomorphic derivations. However, the structure-building rules of MGs but not MCFGs are deﬁned in a way that generalizes across categories. Consequently, MGs can be exponentially more succinct than their MCFG equivalents, and this difference shows in parsing models too. An incremental, top-down beam parser for MGs is deﬁned here, sound and complete for all MGs, and hence also capable of parsing all MCFG languages. But since the parser represents its grammar transparently, the relative succinctness of MGs is again evident. Although the determinants of MG structure are narrowly and discretely deﬁned, probabilistic inﬂuences from a much broader domain can inﬂuence even the earliest analytic steps, allowing frequency and context effects to come early and from almost anywhere, as expected in incremental models.},

The article initially shows how this approach differs from comparative and policy-oriented studies by differentiating between criticism and critique. It then develops the idea of a term-based textual analysis. Using examples from the policy field of foreign aid, the text illustrates how much inherent knowledge there is in the usage of ‘religion’ in political communication and calls for a general reconsideration of the way ‘religion’ is approached in empirical research.},

	abstract = {While labor-displacing AI has the potential to transform critical aspects of society in the near future, previous work has ignored the possibility of the extreme labor displacement scenarios that could result. To explore this we surveyed attendees of three AI conferences in 2018 about near-to-mid-term AI labor displacement as well as five more extreme labor-displacing AI scenarios. Practitioners indicated that a median of 22\% of tasks which humans are currently paid to do could be automated with existing AI; they anticipate this figure rising to 40\% in 5 years and 60\% in 10 years. Median forecasts indicated a 50\% probability of AI systems being capable of automating 90\% of human tasks in 25 years and 99\% of human tasks in 50 years. Practitioners surveyed at the different conferences had similar forecasts for AI labor displacement this decade, but attendees of the Human-level AI Conference had significantly shorter and more precise forecasts for the more extreme labor-displacing AI scenarios. Interestingly, median forecasts of a 10\% probability of 90\% and 99\% of human tasks being automated were 10 years and 15 years, respectively. We conclude that future of work researchers should more carefully consider these relatively high likelihoods of extreme labor-displacing AI scenarios.},

	abstract = {We identify empirical scaling laws for the cross-entropy loss in four domains: generative image modeling, video modeling, multimodal image\${\textbackslash}leftrightarrow\$text models, and mathematical problem solving. In all cases autoregressive Transformers smoothly improve in performance as model size and compute budgets increase, following a power-law plus constant scaling law. The optimal model size also depends on the compute budget through a power-law, with exponents that are nearly universal across all data domains. The cross-entropy loss has an information theoretic interpretation as \$S(\$True\$) + D\_\{{\textbackslash}mathrm\{KL\}\}(\$True\${\textbar}{\textbar}\$Model\$)\$, and the empirical scaling laws suggest a prediction for both the true data distribution's entropy and the KL divergence between the true and model distributions. With this interpretation, billion-parameter Transformers are nearly perfect models of the YFCC100M image distribution downsampled to an \$8{\textbackslash}times 8\$ resolution, and we can forecast the model size needed to achieve any given reducible loss (ie \$D\_\{{\textbackslash}mathrm\{KL\}\}\$) in nats/image for other resolutions. We find a number of additional scaling laws in specific domains: (a) we identify a scaling relation for the mutual information between captions and images in multimodal models, and show how to answer the question "Is a picture worth a thousand words?"; (b) in the case of mathematical problem solving, we identify scaling laws for model performance when extrapolating beyond the training distribution; (c) we finetune generative image models for ImageNet classification and find smooth scaling of the classification loss and error rate, even as the generative loss levels off. Taken together, these results strengthen the case that scaling laws have important implications for neural network performance, including on downstream tasks.},

draft report on timelines to transformative AI. I would love feedback from this
community, so I've made the report viewable in a Google Drive folder here.

With that said, most of my focus so far has been on the high-level structure of
the framework, so the particular quantitative estimates are very much in flux
and many input parameters aren't pinned down well -- I wrote the bulk of this
report before July and have received feedback since then that I haven't fully
incorporated yet. I'd prefer if people didn't share it widely in a low-bandwidth
way (e.g., just posting key graphics on Facebook or Twitter) since the
conclusions don't reflect Open Phil's "institutional view" yet, and there may
well be some errors in the report.

The report includes a quantitative model written in Python. Oughthas worked with
me to integrate their forecasting platform Elicitinto the model so that you can
see other people's forecasts for various parameters. If you have questions or
feedback about the Elicit integration, feel free to reach out to

Looking forward to hearing people's thoughts!},

We evaluate this instruction-tuned model, which we call FLAN, on unseen task types. FLAN substantially improves the performance of its unmodified counterpart and surpasses zero-shot 175B GPT-3 on 19 of 25 tasks that we evaluate. FLAN even outperforms few-shot GPT-3 by a large margin on ANLI, RTE, BoolQ, AI2-ARC, OpenbookQA, and StoryCloze.

Simple equations govern the dependence of overfitting on model/dataset size and the dependence of training speed on model size. These relationships allow us to determine the optimal allocation of a fixed compute budget. Larger models are significantly more sample-efficient, such that optimally compute-efficient training involves training very large models on a relatively modest amount of data and stopping significantly before convergence.},

This report provides a thorough account of the opportunities and risks of foundation models, ranging from their capabilities (e.g., language, vision, robotics, reasoning, human interaction) and technical principles(e.g., model architectures, training procedures, data, systems, security, evaluation, theory) to their applications (e.g., law, healthcare, education) and societal impact (e.g., inequity, misuse, economic and environmental impact, legal and ethical considerations). Though foundation models are based on standard deep learning and transfer learning, their scale results in new emergent capabilities,and their effectiveness across so many tasks incentivizes homogenization. Homogenization provides powerful leverage but demands caution, as the defects of the foundation model are inherited by all the adapted models downstream. Despite the impending widespread deployment of foundation models, we currently lack a clear understanding of how they work, when they fail, and what they are even capable of due to their emergent properties. To tackle these questions, we believe much of the critical research on foundation models will require deep interdisciplinary collaboration commensurate with their fundamentally sociotechnical nature.},

	abstract = {Nine philosophers explore the various issues and questions raised by the newly released language model, GPT-3, in this edition of Philosophers On, guest edited by Annette Zimmermann. Introduction Annette Zimmermann, guest editor GPT-3, a powerful, 175 billion parameter language model developed recently by OpenAI, has been galvanizing public debate and controversy. As the MIT Technology Review puts it: “OpenAI’s new language generator GPT-3 is shockingly good—and completely mindless”. Parts of the technology community hope (and fear) that GPT-3 could brings us one step closer to the hypothetical future possibility of human-like, highly sophisticated artificial general intelligence (AGI). Meanwhile, others (including OpenAI’s own CEO) have critiqued claims about GPT-3’s ostensible proximity to AGI, arguing that they are vastly overstated. Why the hype? As is turns out, GPT-3 is unlike other natural language processing (NLP) systems, the latter of which often struggle with what comes comparatively easily to humans: performing entirely new language tasks based on a few simple instructions and examples. Instead, NLP systems usually have to be pre-trained on a large corpus of text, and then fine-tuned in order to successfully perform a specific task. GPT-3, by contrast, does not require fine tuning of this kind: it seems to be able to perform a whole range of tasks reasonably well, from producing fiction, poetry, and press releases to functioning code, and from music, jokes, and technical manuals, to “news articles which human evaluators have difficulty distinguishing from articles written by humans”. The Philosophers On series contains group posts on issues of current interest, with the aim being to show what the careful thinking characteristic of philosophers (and occasionally scholars in related fields) can bring to popular ongoing conversations. Contributors present not fully worked out position papers but rather brief thoughts that can serve as prompts for further reflection and discussion. The contributors to this installment of “Philosophers On” are Amanda Askell (Research Scientist, OpenAI), David Chalmers (Professor of Philosophy, New York University), Justin Khoo (Associate Professor of Philosophy, Massachusetts Institute of Technology), Carlos Montemayor (Professor of Philosophy, San Francisco State University), C.

	abstract = {The ongoing critical redeployment of primitive accumulation proceeds under two premises. First, it is argued that Marx, erroneously, confined primitive accumulation to the earliest history of capitalism. Second, Marx is supposed to have teleologically justified primitive accumulation as a necessary precondition for socialist development. This article argues that reading Marx’s account of primitive accumulation in the context of contemporaneous debates about working class and socialist strategy rebuts both of these criticisms. Marx’s definition of primitive accumulation as the ‘prehistory of capital’ does not deny its contemporaneity, but marks the distinction between the operations of capital and those of other agencies – especially the state – which are necessary, but also external, to capital itself. This same distinction between capital, which accumulates via the exploitation of labour-power, and the state, which becomes dependent upon capitalist accumulation for its own existence, recasts the historical necessity of primitive accumulation. Marx characterizes the modern state as the armed and servile agent of capital, willing to carry out primitive accumulation wherever the conditions of capitalist accumulation are threatened. Hence, the recent reconstructions risk obliterating Marx’s key insights into the specificity of a) capital as a form of wealth and b) capital’s relationship to the state.},

@article{nichols_theft_nodate,
	title = {Theft {Is} {Property}! {The} {Recursive} {Logic} of {Dispossession}},
	abstract = {This article offers a preliminary critical-historical reconstruction of the concept of dispossession. Part I examines its role in eighteenth- and nineteenthcentury struggles against European feudal land tenure. Drawing upon Marx’s critique of French anarchism in particular, I identify a persistent limitation at the heart of the concept. Since dispossession presupposes prior possession, recourse to it appears conservative and tends to reinforce the very proprietary and commoditized models of social relations that radical critics generally seek to undermine. Part II turns to use of the term in Indigenous struggles against colonization, both in order to better grasp the stakes of the above problematic and suggest a way beyond it. Through a reconstruction of arguments by Indigenous scholars and activists, I seek to show the coherence and novelty of their formulation by suggesting that dispossession has come to name a unique historical process, one in which property is generated under conditions that require divestment and alienation from those who appear, only retroactively, as its original owners. In this way, theft and property are related in a recursive, rather than strictly unilinear, manner. Part III provides a specific historical example in the form of nineteenth-century US property law concerning squatters and homesteaders.},

This attention has coincided with a more general interest among political theorists in the historical and theoretical relationship between liberalism and colonialism. This essay reviews the surviving evidence for Locke’s knowledge of the Carolina colony and argues that it was both more extensive and more enduring than previous commentators have suggested. In particular, the essay provides evidence that Locke was engaged in revising the Fundamental Constitutions of Carolina at just the moment in the summer of 1682 when he was most likely to have composed chapter V of theSecond Treatise and hence that there was an immediate and identifiable colonial context that contributed to his distinctive theory of property.},

Here the foundations and methodology of generative grammar are clariﬁed with the goal of explaining how generative theory already functions as a reasonable source of hypotheses about the representation and computation of language in the mind and brain. The claims of generative theory, as exempliﬁed, e.g., within Chomsky’s (2000) Minimalist Program, are contrasted with those of theories endorsing parallel architectures with independent systems of generative phonology, syntax and semantics. The single generative engine within Minimalist approaches rejects dual routes to linguistic representations, including possible extra-syntactic strategies for semantic structure-building. Clariﬁcation of the implications of this property of generative theory undermines the foundations of an autonomous psycholinguistics, as established in the 1970’s, and brings linguistic theory back to the center of a uniﬁed cognitive neuroscience of language.},

To address this limitation, we express the self-attention as a linear dot-product of kernel feature maps and make use of the associativity property of matrix products to reduce the complexity from O N 2 to O (N ), where N is the sequence length. We show that this formulation permits an iterative implementation that dramatically accelerates autoregressive transformers and reveals their relationship to recurrent neural networks. Our linear transformers achieve similar performance to vanilla transformers and they are up to 4000x faster on autoregressive prediction of very long sequences.},

To this end, we propose new algorithmic innovations such as Causal Sinkhorn Balancing and SortCut, a dynamic sequence truncation method for tailoring Sinkhorn Attention for encoding and/or decoding purposes. Via extensive experiments on algorithmic seq2seq sorting, language modeling, pixel-wise image generation, document classiﬁcation and natural language inference, we demonstrate that our memory efﬁcient Sinkhorn Attention method is competitive with vanilla attention and consistently outperforms recently proposed efﬁcient Transformer models such as Sparse Transformers.},

The ‘umma’ element recurred as a key motive for those who repeated the Arbaeen foot-pilgrimage. The experiential component emerging of the results indicate: religious; bodily; and hospitality/humanitarian aspects to be the signiﬁcant elements of experiences.

Historically da’wa has been directed outward to nonbelievers, but in modern times it has turned increasingly inward to “straying” Muslims. While the media and many scholars have focused on extremism and militant groups that have raised the banner of jihad, this volume argues that da’wa, not jihad, forms the backbone of modern Islamic politics and religiosity, and that the study of da’wa is essential for understanding contemporary Islamic politics as well as jihadist activity. Contributors represent a variety of approaches and come from a range of academic, religious, and national backgrounds. In these essays, they analyze the major discourses of da’wa, their embodiment in the major Islamic movements of the twentieth century, and their transformation into new forms of activism through the media, the state, and jihadi groups—including al-Qaeda and ISIS—in the twenty-first century.},

We employ Graph Neural Networks (GNN) based message passing algorithms to accumulate evidences on the proposed HDE graph.

	abstract = {Recent work has demonstrated substantial gains on many NLP tasks and benchmarks by pre-training on a large corpus of text followed by ﬁne-tuning on a speciﬁc task. While typically task-agnostic in architecture, this method still requires task-speciﬁc ﬁne-tuning datasets of thousands or tens of thousands of examples. By contrast, humans can generally perform a new language task from only a few examples or from simple instructions – something which current NLP systems still largely struggle to do. Here we show that scaling up language models greatly improves task-agnostic, few-shot performance, sometimes even reaching competitiveness with prior state-of-the-art ﬁnetuning approaches. Speciﬁcally, we train GPT-3, an autoregressive language model with 175 billion parameters, 10x more than any previous non-sparse language model, and test its performance in the few-shot setting. For all tasks, GPT-3 is applied without any gradient updates or ﬁne-tuning, with tasks and few-shot demonstrations speciﬁed purely via text interaction with the model. GPT-3 achieves strong performance on many NLP datasets, including translation, question-answering, and cloze tasks, as well as several tasks that require on-the-ﬂy reasoning or domain adaptation, such as unscrambling words, using a novel word in a sentence, or performing 3-digit arithmetic. At the same time, we also identify some datasets where GPT-3’s few-shot learning still struggles, as well as some datasets where GPT-3 faces methodological issues related to training on large web corpora. Finally, we ﬁnd that GPT-3 can generate samples of news articles which human evaluators have difﬁculty distinguishing from articles written by humans. We discuss broader societal impacts of this ﬁnding and of GPT-3 in general.},

Unfortunately, long training times make maximum entropy research difficult. We present a novel speedup technique: we change the form of the model to use classes. Our speedup works by creating two maximum entropy models, the first of which predicts the class of each word, and the second of which predicts the word itself. This factoring of the model leads to fewer nonzero indicator functions, and faster normalization, achieving speedups of up to a factor of 35 over one of the best previous techniques. It also results in typically slightly lower perplexities. The same trick can be used to speed training of other machine learning techniques, e.g. neural networks, applied to any problem with a large number of outputs, such as language modeling.},

	abstract = {General Question Answering (QA) systems over texts require the multi-hop reasoning capability, i.e. the ability to reason with information collected from multiple passages to derive the answer. In this paper we conduct a systematic analysis to assess such an ability of various existing models proposed for multi-hop QA tasks. Specifically, our analysis investigates that whether providing the full reasoning chain of multiple passages, instead of just one final passage where the answer appears, could improve the performance of the existing QA models. Surprisingly, when using the additional evidence passages, the improvements of all the existing multi-hop reading approaches are rather limited, with the highest error reduction of 5.8\% on F1 (corresponding to 1.3\% absolute improvement) from the BERT model. To better understand whether the reasoning chains could indeed help find correct answers, we further develop a co-matching-based method that leads to 13.1\% error reduction with passage chains when applied to two of our base readers (including BERT). Our results demonstrate the existence of the potential improvement using explicit multi-hop reasoning and the necessity to develop models with better reasoning abilities.},

We review Complex Event Recognition techniques that handle, to some extent, uncertainty. We examine techniques based on automata, probabilistic graphical models and first-order logic, which are the most common ones, and approaches based on Petri Nets and Grammars, which are less frequently used. A number of limitations are identified with respect to the employed languages, their probabilistic models and their performance, as compared to the purely deterministic cases. Based on those limitations, we highlight promising directions for future work.},

It seeks to transcend the opposition between particularizing stances, which see religiously informed political conflicts as sui generis and uniquely intractable, and generalizing stances, which assimilate religiously informed political conflicts to other forms of political conflict. The paper specifies the distinctively religious stakes of certain political conflicts, informed by distinctively religious understandings of right order, as well as the distinctiveness of religion as a rich matrix of interlocking modalities and mechanisms that—in certain contexts—can contribute to political conflict and violence even when the stakes are not distinctively religious. At the same time, the paper shows that many putatively religious conflicts are fundamentally similar to other conflicts over political power, economic resources, symbolic recognition, or cultural reproduction.},

The paper identifies explanatory value in these approaches but finds their focus on either ideational structures or individual rationality too narrow to provide a comprehensive explanation of what happened to political identities in Iraq after 2003. Instead, the paper deploys what can be termed a ‘Bourdieusian method’, in an attempt to get beyond the polarities of structure and agency. It uses Bourdieu's conceptions of political field, principles of vision and division and symbolic violence to understand the influence that deBa'athification, the creation of the Muhasasa Ta'ifia or sectarian apportionment system and national elections had on political identities in Iraq since the 2003 invasion.},

Although these characterizations may seem, at times, contradictory, this article argues that they are part of a political structure that initially developed during the Civil War (1975–1990) that was sustained by Lebanon’s post-conﬂict power sharing agreement. This article builds on the critiques present in the developing scholarship on post-conﬂict power sharing, demonstrating how dynamics established as a consequence of the Civil War continued into the postconﬂict period. This has led to the reproduction of sectarian boundary inﬂammation, limitations on democratic and civil society mobilisation, and political stagnation. The article concludes with an analysis of the 2015 Garbage Crisis as exemplary of sustained Civil War dynamics and the consequent constraints on civil society mobilisation caused by these dynamics.},

	abstract = {The relation between state formation and identity in MENA multi‐sectarian societies is examined, taking Syria as a case study. The paper looks at the impact of the mix of sectarianism and nationalism on the formation of state institutions and the impact of the latter on this mix. The flawed export of the Westphalian state system to MENA established the structural context—multiple identities, hybrid states—wherein the two identities compete, overlap, and coexist. Next, the factors that explain varying identity patterns in MENA are surveyed and their likely consequences for state formation; then, reversing the analysis, the impact of state formation and state institutions on the nationalism–sectarianism balance is examined. The Syrian case is briefly discussed in order to illustrate the argument, looking at three periods when the identity balance interacted differently with state formation: pre‐Ba'thist Syria when nationalism eclipsed sectarianism; Ba'thist Syria (1970‐2000) when patrimonial instrumentalization of sectarianism was compensated for by inclusive bureaucratic institutions, populist policies, and nationalist ideology; neo‐liberal Syria under Bashar al‐Asad (2000‐2010) when inclusion shrank, reanimating sectarianism; and civil war Syria (2010‐) when partial state failure fostered exclusionary militant sectarianism at the expense of nationalism.},

	abstract = {Sexual exploitation and abuse (SEA) is an endemic problem in UN peacekeeping missions. It is not only a gross human rights violation, but also threatens to challenge the legitimacy of the peacekeeping mission and undermines the promotion of gender equality in host countries. We examine if the composition of peacekeeping forces along two dimensions - the proportion of women and the records of gender (in)equality in the contributing countries - helps explain variation in SEA allegations. Analysis of mission-level information from 2009 to 2013 indicates that including higher proportions of both female peacekeepers and personnel from countries with better records of gender equality is associated with lower levels of SEA allegations reported against military contingents. We conclude that substantial reductions in SEA perpetrated by peacekeepers requires cultivation of a value for gender equality among all peacekeepers - improving the representation of women may help but still stops short of addressing the root of the problem.},

              ,
              fiqh
              ) as a result of its imbalanced interaction with new European modes of knowing during, and in the immediate aftermath of, the colonial experience. Drawing upon the writings of jurist-scholars from the Ḥanafī school of law writing in Cairo, Kazan, Lucknow, Baghdad, and Istanbul,
              Transformations of Tradition
              reveals several central shifts in Islamic legal writing that throw into doubt the possibility of reading its later trajectory through the lens of a continuous “tradition.” By focusing especially on the work of Muḥammad Bakhīt al-Muṭīʿī, Mufti of Egypt for a time and a leading scholar at the Azhar,
              Transformations of Tradition
              shows that the colonial moment of the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries marked a significant rupture in how Muslim jurists understood history and authority, science and technology, and religion and the secular, thereby upending the very ground upon which Islamic law had until then functioned.},

We call upon the scientific community to put our talents to this challenge by creating decentralised infrastructures for trust-based economic and social cooperation. We empirically demonstrate that a public infrastructure to establish trust between peers in decentralized networks is possible at significant scale. Our work is based on over 15 years of improving our distributed systems which were used by more than a million people. We present six stringent criteria for designing trustworthy infrastructure, called zeroserver architecture. Adhering to these principles, we designed a novel trustworthy networking infrastructure, called P2PApps. It enables smartphone apps to communicate without any servers, by forming a scalable overlay that uses our generic mechanism to build trust between peers, Trustchain. P2P-Apps are generic and can be expanded to serve as an alternative to centralized infrastructure owned by Big Tech.},

Do women need to be negotiators, mediators? Do peace agreements adequately represent women’s interests when women are included? This article engages UNSC Resolution 1325 on Women, Peace and Security as a framework through which to assess peace processes and agreements. A woman-focused examination of all civil war peace processes reveals that less than 10\% meet women’s inclusion as envisioned in UNSCR 1325. This article focuses on the three conditions accounting for women’s substantive representation in peacebuilding. What emerges are three joint necessities: an explicit women’s agenda; access to the peace process; and advocacy within the process.

	abstract = {This paper will elaborate upon elements of what is called here gender and globalized violence. The consensus amongst most observers of global politics is that armed conflict has escalated throughout the post-Cold War period, and has been predominantly internal in nature. One of the defining features of these 'new' conflicts are the gendered nature of mass displacements, gender-based and sexual violence, ethnic cleansing and genocide. Though the causes of conflict are varied, a primary emphasis in UN and other official documents focuses on the political dimensions of conflict. Whether or not the historical legacies of colonialism, competition over scarce resources, political or economic inequities, or ethnic, ideological, or religious difference erupts into outbreaks of violent conflict depend very much on whether appropriate and effective coping mechanisms exist, including well functioning governance and rule of law institutions.Far less common in UN or other accounts of conflict is any acknowledgment of, as Anne Orford writes, the relationship between insecurity and economic liberalization, or the ways in which the international division of labour is itself a violent process. Rather, armed conflict is identified as the moment in which fighting broke out. It is understood to have root causes which preceded the actual outbreak of violence but which - even if they are multidimensional causes - can be addressed by supporting the development of national and regional capacities for early warning, conflict prevention and long-term peacebuilding. Armed conflict, in short, is a problem but it is a problem that can be solved and the UN and other formal organizations have available to them the instruments for doing so: preventive diplomacy, early warning, fact-finding, peacemaking, peacekeeping, confidence building and institution-building. These understandings take place parallel to a number of contemporary intersecting discussions about gender and violence that appear to make gender more visible amongst mainstream observers of global politics. For example, the formal acknowledgment of the specificities of gender in situations of armed conflict (and conflict resolution) that was made in the form of Security Council Resolution 1325 on Women Peace and Security. There have also been a series of discussions about expanding notions of security more generally, which inevitably raise questions of gender. In the UN, and in some national contexts (such as Canada) this has taken the form of theoretical work and policy priorities organized around the idea of 'human security'. In Europe it tends to be organized more around discussions of 'security sector reform'. This paper will outline this context for understanding contemporary armed conflict and the limits of existing conceptualizations and policy efforts. It will also outline an alternative understanding of armed conflict drawn from the work of writers such as Mark Duffield which suggest that contemporary armed conflict is not a departure from normalcy, as such, but rather a complex configuration of processes of social transformation inextricably connected to the inclusions and exclusions associated with contemporary forms of capitalism. Such an understanding would not be one that celebrated the violences of that social transformation, but it would understand them differently, and in particular, would be far less optimistic about the application in discrete moments in time of particular instruments to achieve their resolution.},

	abstract = {"Rudolph Peters' book is about crimes and their punishments as laid down in Islamic law. In recent years some Islamist regimes, such as those of Iran, Pakistan, Sudan and the northern states of Nigeria have reintroduced Islamic law in place of Western criminal codes. This was after the abolition of Islamic criminal law in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries. Previously, during the pre-modern period, Islamic criminal law was applied across the Muslim world and there are many examples of that application in the abundant archives and other sources of the period. Peters gives a detailed account of the classical doctrine and traces the enforcement of criminal law from the Ottoman period to the present day. The accounts of actual cases which range from theft to banditry, murder, fornication and apostasy shed light on the complexities of the law, and the sensitivity and perspicacity of the qadis who implemented it. This is the first single-authored account of both the theory and practice of Islamic criminal law. It will be invaluable for students, and scholars in the field, as well as for professionals looking for a comprehensive coverage of the topic."--Jacket.},

	abstract = {Is prevention the answer to escalating violent conflict? Conflict prevention uses carrots and sticks to deter future violence. Its power thus rests on the credibility of policy-makers’ commitment to supply the carrot or stick in a timely manner. Unfortunately, there are several political and bureaucratic barriers that make this unlikely. First, it is difficult for policy-makers to sell preventive actions to their constituencies. In contrast with core security interests (like nuclear warfare), an uptick in violence in a faraway, nonstrategic country provides a less convincing call for action. Second, preventive decisions are difficult to make. Decision-makers are predisposed to avoid making difficult decisions until a crisis breaks out and they are forced to act. Third, preventive actions are political, not technical, requiring the use of precious political capital for uncertain outcomes whose success may be invisible (manifest in the absence of violence). Perhaps, if decision-makers are able to overcome these obstacles and make more credible commitments to conflict prevention, then conflict prevention will become a more credible solution to violent conflict.},

It argues that peace (and security, development and reconstruction) in societies emerging from violent conflict tends to be a hybrid between the external and the local. The article conceptualizes how this hybrid or composite peace is constructed and maintained. It proposes a four-part conceptual model to help visualize the interplay that leads to hybridized forms of peace. Hybrid peace is the result of the interplay of the following: the compliance powers of liberal peace agents, networks and structures; the incentivizing powers of liberal peace agents, networks and structures; the ability of local actors to resist, ignore or adapt liberal peace interventions; and the ability of local actors, networks and structures to present and maintain alternative forms of peacemaking.},

Each of these raises significant issues concerning the use of force between states and the role of the United Nations in maintaining international peace and security. Alex Conte examines international terrorism and the intervention in Afghanistan, including the controversial policy of pre-emptive strikes in the war on terror, and discusses the role adopted by the United Nations in the political and economic reconstruction of states subjected to conflict. Analyzing events in Iraq since 1990, he assesses the legality of the current war and leads to an examination of the role of the UN in maintaining peace and security and possible options for reform and accountability. The study will be a valuable guide for all those keen to understand the use of international law and the United Nations in the first two major conflicts of the 21st century and their implications for the future role of the United Nations.},

Yet the ways in which Muslim men and women experience the myriad dimensions of sharia often go unnoticed and unpublicized. So too do recent historical changes in sharia judiciaries and contemporary strategies on the part of political and religious elites, social engineers, and brand stewards to shape, solidify, and rebrand these institutions. Sharia Transformations is an ethnographic, historical, and theoretical study of the practice and lived entailments of sharia in Malaysia, arguably the most economically successful Muslim-majority nation in the world. The book focuses on the routine, everyday practices of Malaysia's sharia courts and the changes that have occurred in the court's discourses and practices in recent decades. Michael G.

	abstract = {The role of perception has a significant effect in cases of contemporary peacebuilding. Because the circumstances in which it takes place are highly polarized, groups within the target society tend to be distrustful of change, convinced of their victimization, and suspicious of reforms that do not satisfy the demands of their ethnic, religious, or cultural group. Those factors can lead to resentment against international efforts, especially when reforms require compromise, and a perception that change is externally enforced. A sense of imposition or broken promises can result and spark a local backlash that undermines the legitimacy of reforms and may even result in violence. Because local support is crucial to peacebuilding’s success we need to analyze these perceptual challenges more closely. By learning to understand the role of perception in this non-traditional context we may be able to anticipate the cycle of action and response and prevent it from turning to violence.},

Based on several years of ethnographic research, this article adds another piece to the puzzle, emphasizing the perverse consequences of well-meaning international efforts. I argue that three narratives dominate the public discourse on Congo and eclipse the numerous alternative framings of the situation. These narratives focus on a primary cause of violence, illegal exploitation of mineral resources; a main consequence, sexual abuse of women and girls; and a central solution, extending state authority. I elucidate why simple narratives are necessary for policy makers, journalists, advocacy groups, and practitioners on the ground, especially those involved in the Congo. I then consider each narrative in turn and explain how they achieved prominence: they provided straightforward explanations for the violence, suggested feasible solutions to it, and resonated with foreign audiences. I demonstrate that the focus on these narratives and on the solutions they recommended has led to results that clash with their intended purposes, notably an increase in human rights violations.},

Following the way of historical descriptive studies and the depth of sociological analysis, the study examined the depth of that connection between two types of structures: the first is a traditional structure and the other is a modern one. This study tried to examine the constant political employment of the regime and conformity of interests between it and the tribal elites who aspire to be part of the effective political elites. In this way, the study tried to reach the conclusion that the state has not advanced to form a modern democratic structure. On the other hand, the tribe has not preserved its traditional entity which is built on solidarity in a way that tribal affiliation has become a bridge toward power in a semi-modern State. The tribe has been in conflict with the state and civil institutions in regard to their legislative roles.},

This article explores the legal opinions of the first Muslim judge to be appointed to the High Court, Syed Mahmood. Straddling two competing worlds – that of Cambridge University and that of his native India – Justice Mahmood both legitimated and resisted colonial judicial power. In this essay I will demonstrate how British judges interpreted points of Islamic law within an English legal framework, and how these interpretations contradicted their translated texts of Islamic law, yet became the foundation of legal precedents established through the doctrine of stare decisis. Despite participating within the British colonial judiciary, Mahmood challenged these precedents, demonstrating his ability to navigate the paradoxes of colonial power to secure for himself a legitimate platform from which he could argue his juridical interventions. The efficacy of these challenges, however, ultimately was restrained by the institutions and structures of the colonial jural project.},

Contrary to the prevailing opinion, it will be argued that France, given the circumstances, has undertaken a successful conflict resolution strategy. The controversial implication of France in the 1994 Rwandan genocide made any further French military intervention on the African continent extremely problematic. In the case of the intervention in Côte d’Ivoire, however, France has succeeded in pursuing its interests with full national and international support. Much of the legitimacy of its conflict resolution strategy derives from both the lack of motivation of other international players to act and the inability of African multilateral organizations, such as ECOWAS, to cope with security issues. Since international organizations have been unable to act appropriately, accusations of French neo-colonialism made by the Gbagbo regime and the “young patriots” have never been fully addressed, and the true reconciliation and unification of Ivorian society has been hindered.},

While scholarly research on stabilization has generally focused on militarization, its relationship to peacebuilding in the context of UN peacekeeping is underexplored. This article examines that relationship. A survey of UN policy frameworks highlights the simultaneous emergence of stabilization and clear expressions of peacebuilding. The article then draws on fieldwork in Mali and the Democratic Republic of Congo to illustrate how stabilization is displacing peacebuilding in the practices of UN peacekeeping. The article argues that the politics of stabilization impede local forms of peacebuilding, at odds with the “Sustaining Peace” agenda, and risks jeopardizing the lauded conflict resolution potential of UN peacekeeping.},

Two and a half years of international administration by the United Nations seems to have had little effect on a social and political reality that has evolved by itself. In effect, the UN has given birth to a failed state. The purpose of governorship types of intervention — which attempt to (re)build governments that have collapsed or states that have failed — was to take control of a local political process and break with an abusive past. This aim was the rationale behind the most total form of international administration — UN statehood and international sovereignty in East Timor. In practice, however, the intervention failed to decentralize its own absolutist form of authority, but succeeded in excluding the local population from the equation. If there is to be any future for interventions that are both effective and legitimate, then they will need to guarantee much greater and genuine integration of the local population. ‘Participatory intervention’ is the next doctrinal puzzle to solve in the evolution of international state-building enterprises of any brand.},

	abstract = {The article analyzes the use of force in traditional peacekeeping operations, and secondgeneration peace enforcement operations. It examines two operations in particular, UNIFIL in south Lebanon, and the UN operations in Somalia. Although both missions had different purposes, it is surprising how the interpretation of the rules of engagement (ROE) and the right to resort to force in self-defence were dependent on subjective variables. In the case of Somalia, once the operation was approved under chapter VII, this had a signiﬁcant impact on how commanders viewed their role. In the case of UNIFIL, early confrontation with armed groups set a precedent that to a large extent determined the nature and extent of force used by the peacekeeping force thereafter. However, in the case of both operations, the actual wording of the relevant Security Council resolutions was remarkably vague. This in turn inﬂuenced the application of the ROE, which by their very nature lent themselves to either restrictive or expansive interpretations. The publication of the Brahimi Report, and the report on events that led to the fall of Srebrenica, have questioned the traditional response of UN forces to the use of force and advocated the formulation of a more robust doctrine. The experience of UN forces in Somalia and Lebanon shows that the non-use of force except in self-defence principle has proved controversial and difﬁcult to apply in practice, not least because of its correlation to the other characteristics, especially the need to maintain impartiality.},

	abstract = {A ‘robust turn’ in UN peace operations has ushered in a new generation of missions that are epitomized by increased authorization and willingness to use force towards the protection of vulnerable civilians and the implementation of stabilization strategies. This forceful transformation has important implications for not only particular components of the peace support effort but the overall endeavour. However, the potential unintended consequences remain underexplored and require further attention. This article examines the impacts of this so-called ‘robust turn’ in UN peace operations. The first section maps trends in modern peace operations that comprise the ‘robust turn’. It proceeds to explore a range of repercussions precipitated by these trends with particular focus on unintended consequences. The article concludes by identifying the associated implications for specific missions as well as the peacekeeping endeavour as a whole. It argues that the unintended consequences of the robust turn present significant principled and practical challenges for mission architects and managers, as well as their political masters, in achieving unity of effort in UN peace operations. It further argues that this could have ramifications for the future reputation, substance and viability of UN peacekeeping.},

	abstract = {Until the end of the twentieth century, UN peacekeepers were often prohibited from using force outside self-defense. With the genocides in Rwanda and Srebrenica in the back of their minds, UN officials have recently changed this policy. At present, peacekeepers in the Congo, Sierra Leone, the Ivory Coast and Haiti are explicitly authorized to use force to protect civilians. The new policy is essential in preventing new debacles but it raises a number of ethical questions for peacekeepers. Should the peacekeeper concentrate on the protection of the individual if such protection jeopardizes the community or the mission? Should the peacekeeper solely think in terms of rights and duties, or should he or she also consider consequences? How to deal with the issue of moral engagement versus self-control? Peacekeepers need direction to answer these ethical questions. Unfortunately, conventional locations for finding ethical direction do not provide the guidance that peacekeepers seek. Consequently, peacekeepers will often encounter situations of moral confusion which this article defines as ‘the fog of UN peacekeeping’. The article explains the fog of UN peacekeeping by showing how traditional guidelines fail to provide ethical direction in current peacekeeping operations. Despite the absence of ethical guidelines, soldiers need to prepare for the ‘fog of peacekeeping’. An approach for an adequate preparation in the existing ethical vacuum is offered at the end of the article.},

            The figure of the camp towers over our present. Our planners find it indispensable. Our political grammar finds it unavoidable. Our very conceptions of “the city,” and its once stable inside/outside demarcations, find its challenge insuperable. Not only do more people and more categories of people inhabit camps than ever before, from refugees and migrants to the homeless and detainees, but the camp form today proliferates at the heart of urban space and across the global North/global South divide. Camps are no longer temporary sites of emergency management. They are a global logic of government, an enduring colonial technology at the heart of the response to the climate/border crisis. Taking up the example of the Palestinian refugee camp, this article argues that camps no longer teach us anything about legal exceptions; rather they underline the politics of inhabitation. Camps enact the collapse of the separation between life and politics by making the very fact of inhabitation in itself the basis of political control and contestation. If our world is becoming uninhabitable, the camp, the most common defense against racialized bodies moving to find a place to live, becomes the place where the very political stakes of inhabitation come to the fore.},

	abstract = {Explaining to users why automated systems make certain mistakes is important and challenging. Researchers have proposed ways to automatically produce interpretations for deep neural network models. However, it is unclear how useful these interpretations are in helping users ﬁgure out why they are getting an error. If an interpretation effectively explains to users how the underlying deep neural network model works, people who were presented with the interpretation should be better at predicting the model’s outputs than those who were not. This paper presents an investigation on whether or not showing machine-generated visual interpretations helps users understand the incorrectly predicted labels produced by image classiﬁers. We showed the images and the correct labels to 150 online crowd workers and asked them to select the incorrectly predicted labels with or without showing them the machine-generated visual interpretations. The results demonstrated that displaying the visual interpretations did not increase, but rather decreased, the average guessing accuracy by roughly 10\%.},

	abstract = {Since the advent of Neural Machine Translation (NMT) approaches there has been a tremendous improvement in the quality of automatic translation. However, NMT output still lacks accuracy in some low-resource languages and sometimes makes major errors that need extensive postediting. This is particularly noticeable with texts that do not follow common lexico-grammatical standards, such as user generated content (UGC). In this paper we investigate the challenges involved in translating book reviews from Arabic into English, with particular focus on the errors that lead to incorrect translation of sentiment polarity. Our study points to the special characteristics of Arabic UGC, examines the sentiment transfer errors made by Google Translate of Arabic UGC to English, analyzes why the problem occurs, and proposes an error typology speciﬁc of the translation of Arabic UGC. Our analysis shows that the output of online translation tools of Arabic UGC can either fail to transfer the sentiment at all by producing a neutral target text, or completely ﬂips the sentiment polarity of the target word or phrase and hence delivers a wrong affect message. We address this problem by ﬁne-tuning an NMT model with respect to sentiment polarity showing that this approach can signiﬁcantly help with correcting sentiment errors detected in the online translation of Arabic UGC.},

However, because of model misspeciﬁcation and the use of approximate inference, Bayesian uncertainty estimates are often inaccurate — for example, a 90\% credible interval may not contain the true outcome 90\% of the time. Here, we propose a simple procedure for calibrating any regression algorithm; when applied to Bayesian and probabilistic models, it is guaranteed to produce calibrated uncertainty estimates given enough data. Our procedure is inspired by Platt scaling and extends previous work on classiﬁcation. We evaluate this approach on Bayesian linear regression, feedforward, and recurrent neural networks, and ﬁnd that it consistently outputs well-calibrated credible intervals while improving performance on time series forecasting and model-based reinforcement learning tasks.},

These three are inextricably linked, depending on each other for sustainable peace and prosperity. The purpose of this paper is to explore what role UN peacekeeping operations can play in bringing these three very important pillars of the UN’s work together, in what today are rapidly changing global, regional and local contexts.

In particular, what is the role of UN peacekeeping in institution-building across all of its mandated areas of responsibility? How does the UN work with its partners—including host governments, other UN actors and donor governments—to ensure that peacekeeping, by definition short-term interventions, contribute effectively to longer-term efforts?

This policy brief outlines recent commentary and recommendations on peacebuilding, institution-building and capacity development in UN peacekeeping and examines the diversity of such mandates provided by the Security Council. It explores the range of UN guidance available to peacekeepers in this area and draws out some of the lessons that have been learned and challenges that peacekeepers face as ‘early peacebuilders’ with three key roles: to articulate, enable and implement peacebuilding goals. The policy brief concludes with some reflections of ongoing challenges and opportunities.},

Evidence from a study of the peacekeeping mission in Sierra Leone suggests they are not.

Peacekeepers should focus on peacekeeping, by which they can lay the foundation for peacebuilding. Peacebuilding should be the primary task of national governments and their populations.},

	abstract = {Over 60 years ago, British high court judge Patrick Devlin and legal philosopher H.L.A. Hart fought out a famous debate over the legal enforcement of morality, which was generated by the question of whether homosexuality should be legalized or not. Jurists agree that this debate was won by Hart, also evidenced in the fact that the state has since been retreating from its previous role of moral watchdog. I argue in this article that the two most conflicted and essentially unresolved issues in the integration of Islam, the regulation of the female body and of free speech, have reopened this debate anew, pushing the liberal state toward the legal regulation of morality, thus potentially putting at risk its liberalness. I use the Hart-Devlin debate as a template for comparing and contrasting the Muslim quest for restricting free speech with the host-society quest for restricting the Islamic veil. Accordingly, there is a double threat to liberalism, which this paper brings into view in tandem, one originating from Islam and another from a hypertrophied defense of liberalism.},

In this paper, we focus on natural language processing, introducing methods and resources for training models less sensitive to spurious patterns. Given documents and their initial labels, we task humans with revising each document so that it (i) accords with a counterfactual target label; (ii) retains internal coherence; and (iii) avoids unnecessary changes. Interestingly, on sentiment analysis and natural language inference tasks, classiﬁers trained on original data fail on their counterfactually-revised counterparts and vice versa. Classiﬁers trained on combined datasets perform remarkably well, just shy of those specialized to either domain. While classiﬁers trained on either original or manipulated data alone are sensitive to spurious features (e.g., mentions of genre), models trained on the combined data are less sensitive to this signal. Both datasets are publicly available1.},

Progress has been rapidly accelerating in machine learning models that process language over the last couple of years. This progress has left the research lab and started powering some of the leading digital products. A great example of this is the recent announcement of how the BERT model is now a major force behind Google Search. Google believes this step (or progress in natural language understanding as applied in search) represents “the biggest leap forward in the past five years, and one of the biggest leaps forward in the history of Search”.

This post is a simple tutorial for how to use a variant of BERT to classify sentences. This is an example that is basic enough as a first intro, yet advanced enough to showcase some of the key concepts involved.

Alongside this post, I’ve prepared a notebook. You can see it here the notebook or run it on colab.},

Based on these findings, we describe the beginnings of a path forward by proposing three recommendations that should guide work analyzing "bias" in NLP systems. These recommendations rest on a greater recognition of the relationships between language and social hierarchies, encouraging researchers and practitioners to articulate their conceptualizations of "bias"---i.e., what kinds of system behaviors are harmful, in what ways, to whom, and why, as well as the normative reasoning underlying these statements---and to center work around the lived experiences of members of communities affected by NLP systems, while interrogating and reimagining the power relations between technologists and such communities.},

Using this fine-grained framework, we automatically annotate eight large scale datasets with gender information. In addition, we collect a new, crowdsourced evaluation benchmark. Distinguishing between gender bias along multiple dimensions enables us to train better and more fine-grained gender bias classifiers. We show our classifiers are valuable for a variety of applications, like controlling for gender bias in generative models, detecting gender bias in arbitrary text, and classifying text as offensive based on its genderedness.},

In this paper, we use adversarial training to mitigate this bias, introducing a hate speech classifier that learns to detect toxic sentences while demoting confounds corresponding to AAE texts.

At the core of the challenge is that it is rarely what is stated explicitly, but rather the implied meanings, that frame people's judgments about others. For example, given a statement that “we shouldn't lower our standards to hire more women,” most listeners will infer the implicature intended by the speaker - that “women (candidates) are less qualified.” Most semantic formalisms, to date, do not capture such pragmatic implications in which people express social biases and power differentials in language. We introduce Social Bias Frames, a new conceptual formalism that aims to model the pragmatic frames in which people project social biases and stereotypes onto others. In addition, we introduce the Social Bias Inference Corpus to support large-scale modelling and evaluation with 150k structured annotations of social media posts, covering over 34k implications about a thousand demographic groups. We then establish baseline approaches that learn to recover Social Bias Frames from unstructured text. We find that while state-of-the-art neural models are effective at high-level categorization of whether a given statement projects unwanted social bias (80\% F1), they are not effective at spelling out more detailed explanations in terms of Social Bias Frames. Our study motivates future work that combines structured pragmatic inference with commonsense reasoning on social implications.},

Thus, our methodology involves reducing the influence of confounds through propensity matching and adversarial learning. Our analysis shows how biased comments directed towards female politicians contain mixed criticisms, while comments directed towards other female public figures focus on appearance and sexualization. Ultimately, our work offers a way to capture subtle biases in various domains without relying on subjective human judgements.},

	abstract = {Although measuring held-out accuracy has been the primary approach to evaluate generalization, it often overestimates the performance of NLP models, while alternative approaches for evaluating models either focus on individual tasks or on specific behaviors. Inspired by principles of behavioral testing in software engineering, we introduce CheckList, a task-agnostic methodology for testing NLP models. CheckList includes a matrix of general linguistic capabilities and test types that facilitate comprehensive test ideation, as well as a software tool to generate a large and diverse number of test cases quickly. We illustrate the utility of CheckList with tests for three tasks, identifying critical failures in both commercial and state-of-art models. In a user study, a team responsible for a commercial sentiment analysis model found new and actionable bugs in an extensively tested model. In another user study, NLP practitioners with CheckList created twice as many tests, and found almost three times as many bugs as users without it.},

The best performing models also connect the encoder and decoder through an attention mechanism. We propose a new simple network architecture, the Transformer, based solely on attention mechanisms, dispensing with recurrence and convolutions entirely. Experiments on two machine translation tasks show these models to be superior in quality while being more parallelizable and requiring signiﬁcantly less time to train. Our model achieves 28.4 BLEU on the WMT 2014 Englishto-German translation task, improving over the existing best results, including ensembles, by over 2 BLEU. On the WMT 2014 English-to-French translation task, our model establishes a new single-model state-of-the-art BLEU score of 41.8 after training for 3.5 days on eight GPUs, a small fraction of the training costs of the best models from the literature. We show that the Transformer generalizes well to other tasks by applying it successfully to English constituency parsing both with large and limited training data.},

	abstract = {LSTM-based recurrent neural networks are the state-of-the-art for many natural language processing (NLP) tasks. Despite their performance, it is unclear whether, or how, LSTMs learn structural features of natural languages such as subject-verb number agreement in English. Lacking this understanding, the generality of LSTM performance on this task and their suitability for related tasks remains uncertain. Further, errors cannot be properly attributed to a lack of structural capability, training data omissions, or other exceptional faults. We introduce *influence paths*, a causal account of structural properties as carried by paths across gates and neurons of a recurrent neural network. The approach refines the notion of influence (the subject's grammatical number has influence on the grammatical number of the subsequent verb) into a set of gate or neuron-level paths. The set localizes and segments the concept (e.g., subject-verb agreement), its constituent elements (e.g., the subject), and related or interfering elements (e.g., attractors). We exemplify the methodology on a widely-studied multi-layer LSTM language model, demonstrating its accounting for subject-verb number agreement. The results offer both a finer and a more complete view of an LSTM's handling of this structural aspect of the English language than prior results based on diagnostic classifiers and ablation.},

Despite their ubiquitous usage in downstream tasks, recent increasingly popular projection-based CLE models are almost exclusively evaluated on a single task only: bilingual lexicon induction (BLI). Even BLI evaluations vary greatly, hindering our ability to correctly interpret performance and properties of different CLE models. In this work, we make the first step towards a comprehensive evaluation of cross-lingual word embeddings. We thoroughly evaluate both supervised and unsupervised CLE models on a large number of language pairs in the BLI task and three downstream tasks, providing new insights concerning the ability of cutting-edge CLE models to support cross-lingual NLP. We empirically demonstrate that the performance of CLE models largely depends on the task at hand and that optimizing CLE models for BLI can result in deteriorated downstream performance. We indicate the most robust supervised and unsupervised CLE models and emphasize the need to reassess existing baselines, which still display competitive performance across the board. We hope that our work will catalyze further work on CLE evaluation and model analysis.},

This enables us to utilize both bimodal data of NL-PL pairs and unimodal data, where the former provides input tokens for model training while the latter helps to learn better generators. We evaluate CodeBERT on two NL-PL applications by fine-tuning model parameters. Results show that CodeBERT achieves state-of-the-art performance on both natural language code search and code documentation generation tasks. Furthermore, to investigate what type of knowledge is learned in CodeBERT, we construct a dataset for NL-PL probing, and evaluate in a zero-shot setting where parameters of pre-trained models are fixed.

It improves upon previous work by (1) applying Bert as a masked language model to predict the mixed-in foreign words and (2) basing on the GAN framework with Bert for both the generator and discriminator to further assure the generated sentences similar enough to the natural examples. We evaluate the effectiveness of the generated data by its contribution to ASR. Experiments show our approach can reduce the English word error rate by 1.5\% with the Mandarin-English code-switching spontaneous speech corpus OC16-CE80.},

To this end, we introduce the Cross-lingual TRansfer Evaluation of Multilingual Encoders XTREME benchmark, a multi-task benchmark for evaluating the cross-lingual generalization capabilities of multilingual representations across 40 languages and 9 tasks. We demonstrate that while models tested on English reach human performance on many tasks, there is still a sizable gap in the performance of cross-lingually transferred models, particularly on syntactic and sentence retrieval tasks. There is also a wide spread of results across languages.

	abstract = {In this work, we formulate cross-lingual language model pre-training as maximizing mutual information between multilingual-multi-granularity texts. The unified view helps us to better understand the existing methods for learning cross-lingual representations. More importantly, the information-theoretic framework inspires us to propose a pre-training task based on contrastive learning. Given a bilingual sentence pair, we regard them as two views of the same meaning, and encourage their encoded representations to be more similar than the negative examples. By leveraging both monolingual and parallel corpora, we jointly train the pretext tasks to improve the cross-lingual transferability of pre-trained models. Experimental results on several benchmarks show that our approach achieves considerably better performance. The code and pre-trained models are available at http://aka.ms/infoxlm.},

	abstract = {Recent studies have demonstrated that pre-trained cross-lingual models achieve impressive performance on downstream cross-lingual tasks. This improvement stems from the learning of a large amount of monolingual and parallel corpora. While it is generally acknowledged that parallel corpora are critical for improving the model performance, existing methods are often constrained by the size of parallel corpora, especially for the low-resource languages. In this paper, we propose ERNIE-M, a new training method that encourages the model to align the representation of multiple languages with monolingual corpora, to break the constraint of parallel corpus size on the model performance. Our key insight is to integrate the idea of back translation in the pre-training process. We generate pseudo-parallel sentences pairs on a monolingual corpus to enable the learning of semantic alignment between different languages, which enhances the semantic modeling of cross-lingual models. Experimental results show that ERNIE-M outperforms existing cross-lingual models and delivers new state-of-the-art results on various cross-lingual downstream tasks. The codes and pre-trained models will be made publicly available.},

	abstract = {Arabic is a complex language with limited resources which makes it challenging to produce accurate text classification tasks such as sentiment analysis. The utilization of transfer learning (TL) has recently shown promising results for advancing accuracy of text classification in English. TL models are pre-trained on large corpora, and then fine-tuned on task-specific datasets. In particular, universal language models (ULMs), such as recently developed BERT, have achieved state-of-the-art results in various NLP tasks in English. In this paper, we hypothesize that similar success can be achieved for Arabic. The work aims at supporting the hypothesis by developing the first Universal Language Model in Arabic (hULMonA - حلمنا meaning our dream), demonstrating its use for Arabic classifications tasks, and demonstrating how a pre-trained multi-lingual BERT can also be used for Arabic. We then conduct a benchmark study to evaluate both ULM successes with Arabic sentiment analysis. Experiment results show that the developed hULMonA and multi-lingual ULM are able to generalize well to multiple Arabic data sets and achieve new state of the art results in Arabic Sentiment Analysis for some of the tested sets.},

We explore three language-independent alternatives to morphological segmentation using: i) data-driven sub-word units, ii) characters as a unit of learning, and iii) word embeddings learned using a character CNN (Convolution Neural Network). On the tasks of Machine Translation and POS tagging, we found these methods to achieve close to, and occasionally surpass state-of-the-art performance. In our analysis, we show that a neural machine translation system is sensitive to the ratio of source and target tokens, and a ratio close to 1 or greater, gives optimal performance.},

Drawing on these data, we propose a Bayesian BIN model (Bias, Information, Noise) for disentangling the underlying processes that enable forecasters and forecasting methods to improve – either by tamping down bias and noise in judgment or by ramping up the efficient extraction of valid information from the environment. The BIN model reveals that noise reduction plays a surprisingly consistent role across all three methods of enhancing performance. We see the BIN method as useful in focusing managerial interventions on what works when and why in a wide range of domains. An R-package called BINtools implements our method and is available on the first author’s personal website.},

	doi = {10.1177/0967010619850346},
	abstract = {Since the 1994 genocide and civil war, the Rwandan government has implemented an externally funded disarmament, demobilization and reintegration/security sector reform (DDR/SSR) programme culminating in the consolidation of armed groups into a new, professionalized Rwanda Defence Force. Feminists argue that DDR/SSR initiatives that exclude combatant women and girls or ignore gendered security needs fail to transform the political conditions that led to conflict. Less attention has been paid to how gendered relations of power play out through gender-sensitive DDR and SSR initiatives that seek to integrate women and transform hyper-masculine militarized masculinities. This article investigates how Rwanda’s DDR/SSR programme is governed by an oppressive masculine logic. Drawing on critical studies on men and masculinities and feminist work on peacebuilding, myths and the politics of belonging, it argues that Rwanda’s locally owned DDR/SSR programme places the military and militarization at the centre of the country’s nation-building programme. Through various ‘boundary-construction’ practices, the Rwandan government attempts to stabilize the post-1994 gender order and entrench the hegemony of a new militarized masculinity in Rwandan society. The case study draws on field research conducted in 2014 and 2015 and a discourse analysis of historical accounts, policy documents and training materials of the Rwanda Defence Force.},

The purpose of the current article is to provide a comprehensive overview of this literature and of the theoretical progress that it has prompted. We start with a description of the DSP task and the phenomena that are typically observed with it. Then we propose a cognitive model, the dual processor model (DPM), which explains performance of (skilled) discrete key-press sequences. Key features of this model are the distinction between a cognitive processor and a motor system (i.e., motor buffer and motor processor), the interplay between these two processing systems, and the possibility to execute familiar sequences in two different execution modes. We further discuss how this model relates to several related sequence skill research paradigms and models, and we outline outstanding questions for future research throughout the paper. We conclude by sketching a tentative neural implementation of the DPM.},

However, the effectiveness of cross-lingual transfer can be challenged by variation in syntactic structures. Frameworks such as Universal Dependencies (UD) are designed to be cross-lingually consistent, but even in carefully designed resources trees representing equivalent sentences may not always overlap. In this paper, we measure cross-lingual syntactic variation, or anisomorphism, in the UD treebank collection, considering both morphological and structural properties. We show that reducing the level of anisomorphism yields consistent gains in cross-lingual transfer tasks. We introduce a source language selection procedure that facilitates effective cross-lingual parser transfer, and propose a typologically driven method for syntactic tree processing which reduces anisomorphism. Our results show the effectiveness of this method for both machine translation and cross-lingual sentence similarity, demonstrating the importance of syntactic structure compatibility for boosting cross-lingual transfer in NLP.},

We show that such networks will also learn number agreement within unnatural sentence structures, i.e. structures that are not found within any natural languages and which humans struggle to process. These results suggest that the models are learning from their input in a manner that is substantially different from human language acquisition, and we undertake an analysis of how the learned knowledge is stored in the weights of the network. We find that while the model has an effective understanding of singular versus plural for individual sentences, there is a lack of a unified concept of number agreement connecting these processes across the full range of inputs. Moreover, the weights handling natural and unnatural structures overlap substantially, in a way that underlines the non-human-like nature of the knowledge learned by the network.},

	abstract = {Islamic almsgiving is on the rise among Muslims in India, as charitable donations by individuals come to supplant landed endowments as the lifeblood of many Islamic associations. Techniques of mass fundraising in India by Islamic revivalist movements such as Deoband facilitated their expansion across the subcontinent. Such fundraising depended on documentary practices such as veriﬁcation letters, lists of donors, and receipts for donations. This article illustrates how charity receipts and other documents that change hands in ritual Islamic almsgiving are also a key part of new Indian Muslim collective identities. Moral ties as well as money circulate in this Islamic charity economy. Financial documents are Islamic philanthropy’s answer to ‘print capitalism’, serving as material rituals of symbolic community across vast distances. Moreover, the use of documents in traditional Islamic almsgiving is also inﬂecting pious Muslims’ spiritualities. Islamic charity receipts in particular are contributing to the individualization of religiosity among Lucknow Muslims. New modes of accounting (originally intended to ensure ﬁnancial compliance) also allow Muslim almsgivers to ‘account’ for accrued piety in a perceived spiritual merit economy.},

Our word vectors are learned functions of the internal states of a deep bidirectional language model (biLM), which is pretrained on a large text corpus. We show that these representations can be easily added to existing models and signiﬁcantly improve the state of the art across six challenging NLP problems, including question answering, textual entailment and sentiment analysis. We also present an analysis showing that exposing the deep internals of the pre-trained network is crucial, allowing downstream models to mix different types of semi-supervision signals.},

	abstract = {Amidst the politics of the Mamluk-era spice route, why did the standard-bearers of Islamic law routinely oppose the sultanate’s imposition of an alms-tax on merchandise (zakāt al-tijāra), despite the abundance of support for such a tax within the classical tradition of Islamic law? Rather than contending – as some modern scholars have – that prominent jurists developed loopholes that circumvented the original intent of the law to protect the wealthy and the ruling class, I argue that it was precisely the jurists’ careful defense of exemptions and exclusions that allowed them to define the essence of zakāt against forms of taxation they considered unlawful. By narrowing the scope of zakāt, jurists attempted to achieve a moral aim that went beyond the ritual purification of wealth: a limit on the sultanate’s otherwise arbitrary power to tax Muslims as it wished. In doing so, they alleviated some of the tax burden for spice merchants and camel herders alike.},

Emphasis on a self-contained number of jurisprudential texts was in fact one of the outcomes of a profound process of transformation in the Islamic legal episteme among the Muslim communities of Central Eurasia. One of the forces behind such a transformation can be identified in what Sheldon Pollock has termed “vernacularization” – that is, a shift toward the popularization of a cosmopolitan body of scholarship through the medium of translation into local languages. The act of translation itself reflected the effort to select, domesticate, and naturalize, specific juristic texts, the contents of which were perceived as important, though equally inaccessible. Translation led to distinction and preferment. It also brought about a process of “debasement”, i.e., a movement toward the decontextualization of Islamic jurisprudential writing traditions and their reworking into original works written in the vernacular Turkic, which blended the genre of creeds with jurisprudence.},

Inconclusive decisions can be correct decisions, but they can also be incorrect decisions. Errors can occur when inconclusive evidence is determined as an identification or exclusion, or conversely, when same- or different-source evidence is incorrectly determined as inconclusive. We present four common flaws in error rate studies: 1. Not including test items which are more prone to error; 2. Excluding inconclusive decisions from error rate calculations; 3. Counting inconclusive decisions as correct in error rate calculations; and 4. Examiners resorting to more inconclusive decisions during error rate studies than they do in casework. These flaws seriously undermine the credibility and accuracy of error rates reported in studies. To remedy these shortcomings, we present the problems and show the way forward by providing a corrected experimental design that quantifies error rates more accurately.},

Since frequentist properties such as unbiasedness and coverage are valid only before the data have been observed, there are no guarantees if we condition on signiﬁcance. In fact, the signiﬁcance ﬁlter leads to overestimation of the magnitude of the parameter, which has been called the “winner’s curse”. It can also lead to undercoverage of the conﬁdence interval. Moreover, these problems become more severe if the power is low. While these issues clearly deserve our attention, they have been studied only informally and mathematical results are lacking. Here we study them from the frequentist and the Bayesian perspective. We prove that the relative bias of the magnitude is a decreasing function of the power and that the usual conﬁdence interval undercovers when the power is less than 50\%. We conclude that failure to apply the appropriate amount of shrinkage can lead to misleading inferences.},

The structure of such a system is specified by a dependence graph G having m vertices, in which the directed edges are labeled with integer n-vectors. For certain choices of the set R, necessary and sufficient conditions on G are given for the existence of a schedule to compute all the quantities at(p) explicitly from their defining equations. Properties of such schedules, such as the degree to which c o m p u t a t i o n can proceed "in parallel," are characterized. These characterizations depend on a certain iterative decomposition of a dependence graph into subgraphs. Analogous results concerning implicit schedules are also given.},

	url = {http://arxiv.org/abs/2012.08623},
	abstract = {We present a clean, magnitude-limited (IRAC1 or WISE1\${\textbackslash}leq\$15.0 mag) multiwavelength source catalog for the LMC. The catalog was built upon crossmatching (\$1''\$) and deblending (\$3''\$) between the SEIP source list and Gaia DR2, with strict constraints on the Gaia astrometric solution to remove the foreground contamination. The catalog contains 197,004 targets in 52 different bands including 2 ultraviolet, 21 optical, and 29 infrared bands. Additional information about radial velocities and spectral/photometric classifications were collected from the literature. The bright end of our sample is mostly comprised of blue helium-burning stars (BHeBs) and red HeBs with inevitable contamination of main sequence stars at the blue end. After applying modified magnitude and color cuts based on previous studies, we identify and rank 2,974 RSG, 508 YSG, and 4,786 BSG candidates in the LMC in six CMDs. The comparison between the CMDs of the LMC and SMC indicates that the most distinct difference appears at the bright red end of the optical and near-infrared CMDs, where the cool evolved stars (e.g., RSGs, AGB, and RGs) are located, which is likely due to the effect of metallicity and SFH. Further quantitative comparison of colors of massive star candidates in equal absolute magnitude bins suggests that, there is basically no difference for the BSG candidates, but large discrepancy for the RSG candidates as LMC targets are redder than the SMC ones, which may be due to the combined effect of metallicity on both spectral type and mass-loss rate, and also the age effect. The \$T\_\{{\textbackslash}rm eff\}\$ of massive star populations are also derived from reddening-free color of \$(J-K\_\{{\textbackslash}rm S\})\_0\$. The \$T\_\{{\textbackslash}rm eff\}\$ ranges are \$3500{\textless}T\_\{{\textbackslash}rm eff\}{\textless}5000\$ K for RSG population, \$5000{\textless}T\_\{{\textbackslash}rm eff\}{\textless}8000\$ K for YSG population, and \$T\_\{{\textbackslash}rm eff\}{\textgreater}8000\$ K for BSG population, with larger uncertainties towards the hotter stars.},

	abstract = {Control theory deals with the control of dynamical systems  in engineered processes and machines. The objective is to develop a control model for controlling such systems using a control action in an optimum manner without delay or overshoot and ensuring control stability.
To do this, a controller with the requisite corrective behavior is required. This controller monitors the controlled process variable (PV), and compares it with the reference or set point (SP). The difference between actual and desired value of the process variable, called the error signal, or SP-PV error, is applied as feedback to generate a control action to bring the controlled process variable to the same value as the set point. Other aspects which are also studied are  controllability and observability. This is the basis for the advanced type of automation that revolutionized manufacturing, aircraft, communications and other industries. This is feedback control, which involves taking measurements using a sensor and making calculated adjustments to keep the measured variable within a set range by means of a "final control element", such as a control valve.Extensive use is usually made of a diagrammatic style known as the block diagram. In it the transfer function, also known as the system function or network function, is a mathematical model of the relation between the input and output based on the differential equations describing the system.
Control theory dates from the 19th century, when the theoretical basis for the operation of governors was first described by James Clerk Maxwell.  Control theory was further advanced by Edward Routh in 1874, Charles Sturm and in 1895, Adolf Hurwitz, who all contributed to the establishment of control stability criteria; and from 1922 onwards, the development of PID control theory by Nicolas Minorsky.
Although a major application of mathematical control theory is in control systems engineering, which deals with the design of process control systems for industry, other applications range far beyond this. As the general theory of feedback systems, control theory is useful wherever feedback occurs - thus control theory also has applications in life sciences, computer engineering, sociology and operation research.},

	abstract = {This manuscript surveys reinforcement learning from the perspective of optimization and control with a focus on continuous control applications. It surveys the general formulation, terminology, and typical experimental implementations of reinforcement learning and reviews competing solution paradigms. In order to compare the relative merits of various techniques, this survey presents a case study of the Linear Quadratic Regulator (LQR) with unknown dynamics, perhaps the simplest and best-studied problem in optimal control. The manuscript describes how merging techniques from learning theory and control can provide non-asymptotic characterizations of LQR performance and shows that these characterizations tend to match experimental behavior. In turn, when revisiting more complex applications, many of the observed phenomena in LQR persist. In particular, theory and experiment demonstrate the role and importance of models and the cost of generality in reinforcement learning algorithms. This survey concludes with a discussion of some of the challenges in designing learning systems that safely and reliably interact with complex and uncertain environments and how tools from reinforcement learning and control might be combined to approach these challenges.},

By extension, it may also have hypothetical or metaphorical references, e.g. in a nom de guerre or a nickname, without literally referring to a son or a daughter. Use of a kunya implies a familiar but respectful setting.
A kunya is expressed by the use of abū (father) or umm (mother) in a genitive construction, i.e. "father of" or "mother of" as an honorific in place of or alongside given names in the Arab world and the Islamic world more generally.},

Compliance occurs when individuals are coerced to join by powerful influence agents. Internalization occurs when individuals join due to a perceived convergence between the self and the group. We searched for evidence of each of these pathways in field investigations of former members of two renowned terrorist organizations: The Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTEE) (Study 1) and Islamist radical groups (Study 2). Results indicated that ex-fighters joined LTTE for reasons associated with both compliance and internalization but that ex-fighters joined Islamist radical groups primarily for reasons associated with internalization. When compliance occurred, it often took the form of coercion within LTTE but involved charismatic persuasion agents within Islamist groups. This evidence of systematic differences in the reasons why fighters enter violent groups suggests that strategies for preventing radicalization and fostering de-radicalization should be tailored to particular groups.},

This Research Note explores ISIS’s use of disabled fighters through an analysis of online content, consisting of videos collected off the encrypted messaging platform Telegram, along with open-source Internet sites, bearing in mind the concepts of Entertainment-Education and the use of persuasive messaging. I argue that ISIS is using its own method of Entertainment-Education, employing persuasive narrative aimed at disabled individuals, while also using them as propaganda tools.

Thirty years after Taif, Lebanese capitalism is facing another crisis: public debt, a looming currency crisis, failing public services. Explanations that focus solely on the sectarian “weak state” or on Syrian refugees neglect the crucial importance of Lebanon’s dependence on Gulf rentierism. Using recent studies of income and poverty, this article shows how postwar capitalism benefited rentier capitalists at the top, created a precarious middle class, and perpetuated poverty. Economic protests mobilize the precarious middle and they revolve around failing public services.},

While there is growing interest in AI ethics and its implications for humanity, there has been surprisingly little consideration of its implications for national identities and nationalism. This paper argues that the transformation of citizens into population data is driving changes to state sovereignty and that the simultaneous competition between (and within) states and global corporations on a structural level and expansion of algorithmic population management on a quotidian level may crystallize in ways that are likely to produce nationalist responses. It concludes by proposing a number of causal mechanisms and hypotheses regarding the emergence and spread of “AI nationalism.” Scholars in nationalism studies can benefit substantially from embracing the study and applications of AI, though they ignore its development and spread at their peril.},

Today, the increasing use of containers has paved the way for core distributed system patterns and reusable containerized components. This practical guide presents a collection of repeatable, generic patterns to help make the development of reliable distributed systems far more approachable and efficient. Author Brendan Burns—Director of Engineering at Microsoft Azure—demonstrates how you can adapt existing software design patterns for designing and building reliable distributed applications. Systems engineers and application developers will learn how these long-established patterns provide a common language and framework for dramatically increasing the quality of your system. •Understand how patterns and reusable components enable the rapid development of reliable distributed systems •Use the side-car, adapter, and ambassador patterns to split your application into a group of containers on a single machine •Explore loosely coupled multi-node distributed patterns for replication, scaling, and communication between the components •Learn distributed system patterns for large-scale batch data processing covering work-queues, event-based processing, and coordinated workflows},

	abstract = {The title of the book sounds a bit mysterious. Why should anyone read this book if it presents the subject in a wrong way? What is particularly done “wrong” in the book? Before answering these questions, let me first describe the target au- dience of this text. This book appeared as lecture notes for the course “Honors Linear Algebra”. It supposed to be a first linear algebra course for mathematically advanced students. It is intended for a student who, while not yet very familiar with abstract reasoning, is willing to study more rigor- ous mathematics than what is presented in a “cookbook style” calculus type course. Besides being a first course in linear algebra it is also supposed to be a first course introducing a student to rigorous proof, formal definitions—in short, to the style of modern theoretical (abstract) mathematics. The target audience explains the very specific blend of elementary ideas and concrete examples, which are usually presented in introductory linear algebra texts with more abstract definitions and constructions typical for advanced books. Another specific of the book is that it is not written by or for an alge- braist. So, I tried to emphasize the topics that are important for analysis, geometry, probability, etc., and did not include some traditional topics. For example, I am only considering vector spaces over the fields of real or com- plex numbers. Linear spaces over other fields are not considered at all, since I feel time required to introduce and explain abstract fields would be better spent on some more classical topics, which will be required in other dis- ciplines. And later, when the students study general fields in an abstract algebra course they will understand that many of the constructions studied in in this book will also work for general fields.},

While it is known that not all optional features are implemented and nonconformance exists, one would assume that TCP implementations at least conform to the minimum set of MUST requirements. In this paper, we use Internet-wide scans to show how Internet hosts and paths conform to these basic requirements. We uncover a non-negligible set of hosts and paths that do not adhere to even basic requirements. For example, we observe hosts that do not correctly handle checksums and cases of middlebox interference for TCP options. We identify hosts that drop packets when the urgent pointer is set or simply crash. Our publicly available results highlight that conformance to even fundamental protocol requirements should not be taken for granted but instead checked regularly.},

I focus in the second half of the article on the consequences of humanitarianism as politics, which include new biopolitical practices, unexpected diseased and disabled citizens, and a limited version of what it means to be human.},

This paper considers a document authored by one such professional, Albert Winsemius, and draws on Antonio Gramsci’s concept of passive revolution to theorize the process of state formation in Singapore. By examining Winsemius’ role in Singapore’s development planning, we demonstrate how globally sourced, ideological anti-communism and transnational economic expertise were inscribed into the institutional structure of the Singaporean state under Lee Kuan Yew and the People’s Action Party. Basing our analysis in a close reading of a key economic planning document, we argue that Winsemius and the Industrial Survey Mission demonstrate a political understanding of state formation rooted in the need to suppress labour strife and maintain political stability. This paper contributes to a more spatially nuanced understanding of East Asian industrialization and state transformation through a theorization of the influence of transnational expertise on an archetypal ‘developmental state’.},

A meta-analysis of procrastination’s possible causes and effects, based on 691 correlations, reveals that neuroticism, rebelliousness, and sensation seeking show only a weak connection. Strong and consistent predictors of procrastination were task aversiveness, task delay, selfefficacy, and impulsiveness, as well as conscientiousness and its facets of self-control, distractibility, organization, and achievement motivation. These effects prove consistent with temporal motivation theory, an integrative hybrid of expectancy theory and hyperbolic discounting. Continued research into procrastination should not be delayed, especially because its prevalence appears to be growing.},

In Arabian Satire, Ḥmēdān is mostly concerned with worldly matters and addresses these in different guises: as the patriarch at the helm of the family boat and its unruly crew; as a picaresque anti-hero who revels in taking potshots at the established order, its hypocrisy, and its failings; as a peasant who labors over his palm trees, often to no avail and with no guarantee of success; and as a poet recording in verse how he thinks things ought to be. The poems in Arabian Satire reveal a plucky, headstrong, yet intensely socially committed figure-representative of the traditional Najdīethos-who infuses his verse with proverbs, maxims, and words of wisdom expressed plainly and conversationally. Ḥmēdān is widely quoted by historians of the Gulf region and in anthologies of popular sayings. This is the first full translation of this remarkable poet"--},

Microprocessors are among those artiﬁcial information processing systems that are both complex and that we understand at all levels, from the overall logical ﬂow, via logical gates, to the dynamics of transistors. Here we take a simulated classical microprocessor as a model organism, and use our ability to perform arbitrary experiments on it to see if popular data analysis methods from neuroscience can elucidate the way it processes information. We show that the approaches reveal interesting structure in the data but do not meaningfully describe the hierarchy of information processing in the processor.

	abstract = {In structural engineering, the Bouc–Wen model of hysteresis is one of the most used hysteretic models typically employed to describe non-linear hysteretic systems. It was introduced by Robert Bouc and extended by Yi-Kwei Wen, who demonstrated its versatility by producing a variety of hysteretic patterns.
This model is able to capture, in analytical form, a range of hysteretic cycle shapes matching the behaviour of a wide class of hysteretical systems. Due to its versatility and mathematical tractability, the Bouc–Wen model has gained popularity. It has been extended and applied to a wide variety of engineering problems, including multi-degree-of-freedom (MDOF) systems, buildings, frames, bidirectional and torsional response of hysteretic systems, two- and three-dimensional continua, soil liquefaction and base isolation systems. The Bouc–Wen model, its variants and extensions have been used in structural control—in particular, in the modeling of behaviour of magneto-rheological dampers, base-isolation devices for buildings and other kinds of damping devices. It has also been used in the modelling and analysis of structures built of reinforced concrete, steel, masonry, and timber.},

Whilst literature continues to grow, results have been inconsistent with variations in the impact recorded. Although the literature has continued to debate if a relationship exists between CCTs and crime, it fails to demonstrate how these programmes might impact crime. Utilising social control theory, the paper demonstrates how CCT programmes can facilitate crime reduction by strengthening social bonds. Drawing on the research, evidence is examined for each social bond, thus demonstrating the potential for CCTs to diminish crime. This paper concludes that further research is needed to give credence to the application of social control theory but by applying the theory to CCTs it offers the first theoretical understanding of relationships between CCTs and crime.},

However, conﬂicting evidence has emerged leading to questions concerning the robustness of the bilingual advantage for both executive functions and dementia incidence. Some investigators have failed to ﬁnd evidence of a bilingual advantage; others have suggested that bilingual advantages may be entirely spurious, while proponents of the advantage case have continued to defend it. A heated debate has ensued, and the ﬁeld has now reached an impasse. This review critically examines evidence for and against the bilingual advantage in executive functions, cognitive aging, and brain plasticity, before outlining how future research could shed light on this debate and advance knowledge of how experience with multiple languages affects cognition and the brain.},

	abstract = {This new Handbook examines the issues, challenges, and debates surrounding the problem of security in Africa. Africa is home to most of the world's current conflicts, and security is a key issue. However, African security can only be understood by employing different levels of analysis: the individual (human security), the state (national/state security), and the region (regional/international security). Each of these levels provides analytical tools for understanding what could be called the "African security predicament" and these debates are animated by the "new security" issues: immigration, small arms transfers, gangs and domestic crime, HIV/AIDS, transnational crime, poverty, and environmental degradation. African security therefore not only presents concrete challenges for international security but provides a real-world context for challenging conventional conceptions of security. Drawing together contributions from a wide range of key thinkers in the field, the Routledge Handbook of African Security engages with these debates, and is organized into four parts:   Part I: The African security predicament in the twenty-first century;   Part II: Understanding conflict in Africa;   Part III: Regionalism and Africa;   Part IV: External influences.  This Handbook will be of great interest to students of African politics, human security, global security, war and conflict studies, peacebuilding, and IR in general.},

Hirschi carefully examined the underlying assumptions of extant theories of crime in light of what was known about the individual-level correlates of offending. He then developed critical tests of hypotheses derived from social control theory and competing perspectives and empirically assessed them using original self-report delinquency data. Many of his key findings, such as the negative correlation between attachment to parents and delinquency, are now established facts that any explanation of crime must consider. Causes of Delinquency is still cited hundreds of times per year, and it continues to spark new research and theoretical development in the field. Perhaps the most lasting legacy is the volume of criticism it has attracted and fended off, leading to its enduring contribution to the study of crime and delinquency.},

Various definitions and approaches to estimating the equilibrium real interest rate are examined, including approaches based on the term structure of interest rates and small macroeconomic models. The individual country approaches common in the literature are extended to allow for global trend and cyclical factors. The analysis finds that global factors dominate the downward trend in the equilibrium interest rate across 13 advanced economies. A corollary of this finding is that the U.S. equilibrium rate can be informed by global developments and is recently lower than estimated in U.S.-only studies. The analysis also highlights how the common global trend confounds empirical assessments of the determinants of movements in the equilibrium rate and the need to better integrate term-structure and macroeconomic approaches.},

By contrast, microfoundations are generally not identified. We discuss and assess the various approaches developed by economists to account for correlated effects and network endogeneity in particular. We classify these approaches in four broad categories: random peers, random shocks, structural endogeneity, and panel data. We review an emerging literature relaxing the assumption that the network is perfectly known.

This book brings together a knowledge of the city from multiple perspectives; knowledge that is, without any doubt, impressive for its extension and profoundity, as well as for its capacity to combine objective data with conceptual reflections about the scope and impact of the different perspectives concerning the theme of urban transformation and the different actors that have participated in such processes. The book weaves a broad net over the city, its history and development, adopting a multidisciplinary vision. I think that this will be the first step in creating a speech that might finally liberate itself from the strict disciplinary boundaries, building a trans-disciplinary perspective that can amplify the urban dimension of the city. This is the beginning of a profound and complex reflection that is, at the same time, a project of knowledge and an instrument of action and participation.},

Contrary to the opportunity-cost theory, the data emphatically reject a positive correlation between unemployment and attacks against government and allied forces (p{\textless}.05\%). There is no significant relationship between unemployment and the rate of insurgent attacks that kill civilians. We identify several potential explanations, introducing the notion of insurgent precision to adjudicate between the possibilities that predation on the one hand, and security measures and information costs on the other, account for the negative correlation between unemployment and violence in these three conflicts.},

	abstract = {More than a decade after the U.S.-led invasion of Iraq, most studies of the Iraq conflict focus on the twin questions of whether the United States should have entered Iraq in 2003 and whether it should have exited in 2011, but few have examined the new Iraqi state and society on its own merits. Iraq after America examines the government and the sectarian and secular factions that have emerged in Iraq since the U.S. invasion of 2003, presenting the interrelations among the various elements in the Iraqi political scene. The book traces the origins of key trends in recent Iraqi history to explain the political and social forces that produced them, particularly during the intense period of civil war between 2003 and 2009. Along the way, the author looks at some of the most significant players in the new Iraq, explaining how they have risen to prominence and what their aims are. The author identifies the three trends that dominate Iraq's post-U.S. political order: authoritarianism, sectarianism, and Islamist resistance, tracing their origins and showing how they have created a toxic political and social brew, preventing Iraq's political elite from resolving the fundamental roots of conflict that have wracked that country since 2003 and before. He concludes by examining some aspects of the U.S. legacy in Iraq, analyzing what it means for the United States and others that, after more than a decade of conflict, Iraq's communitiesand its political class in particularhave not yet found a way to live together in peace.},

However, due to limited model capacity, their transfer performance is the weakest exactly on such low-resource languages and languages unseen during pretraining. We propose MAD-X, an adapter-based framework that enables high portability and parameter-efﬁcient transfer to arbitrary tasks and languages by learning modular language and task representations. In addition, we introduce a novel invertible adapter architecture and a strong baseline method for adapting a pretrained multilingual model to a new language. MAD-X outperforms the state of the art in cross-lingual transfer across a representative set of typologically diverse languages on named entity recognition and causal commonsense reasoning, and achieves competitive results on question answering.

Rigorous evidence is rare. We experimentally evaluate a program of agricultural training, capital inputs, and counseling for Liberian ex-ﬁghters who were illegally mining or occupying rubber plantations. 14 months after the program ended, men who accepted the program oﬀer increased their farm employment and proﬁts, and shifted work hours away from illicit activities. Men also reduced interest in mercenary work in a nearby war. Finally, some men did not receive their capital inputs but expected a future cash transfer instead, and they reduced illicit and mercenary activities most of all. The evidence suggests that illicit and mercenary labor supply responds to small changes in returns to peaceful work, especially future and ongoing incentives. But the impacts of training alone, without capital, appear to be low.},

Based in the state of the art in theory and practice of peacebuilding, planning and evaluation, the book introduces the "Aid for Peace" approach and walks the user through a systematic and comprehensive step by step process. The user understands how to analyze and anticipate conflict dynamics and peacebuilding needs, plan new interventions and evaluate existing ones, map her or his own intervention and assess its relevance for peacebuilding, assess the effects of interventions on peace and conflict by making hypotheses of change explicit and operational, integrate the conflict and peace lens into standard planning and evaluation procedures and criteria as well as organizational structures, combine a strategic with a process understanding in building a vision for peacebuilding for better contributing to conflict transformation and social change. Written for a broad readership, "Aid for Peace" leads to the creation of an appropriate policy, project or program design for working in conflict zones."--P. 4 of cover},

We examined the psychosocial conditions faced by 223 ex-combatants from the People’s Liberation Army and 213 host community stake­ holders in Nepal in 2012 and 2013, specifically investigating the relation between Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD), factional ties and Readiness to Reconcile in ex-combatants. Despite ex-combatants’ posi­ tive attitudes and perceptions of their host communities, many struggled to generate an income. Ex-combatants who were likely to suffer from PTSD reported lower readiness to reconcile with former enemies. Having factional ties did not impact willingness to reconcile, but was associated with reduced PTSD. Most community stakeholders positively regarded the arrival of these ex-combatants. However, a minority expressed alarm about political differences, war grievances and ex-combatants’ problematic behaviour. Critical activities identified to facilitate social reintegration are psychosocial trauma support and counselling, social interaction and peace education programmes and continued socio-economic support for both communities and excombatants.},

Twenty-two years after the Bosnian war ended, little attention has been given to the men who suffered diverse forms of sexual violence during the conflict. The present article contributes to addressing this gap. Based on semi-structured interviews with 10 men who endured the horrors of the Čelopek camp in north-east BiH, it focuses on the lives of these men today. Exploring the men’s silences and the intersection of their trauma with ongoing everyday problems, it goes beyond the commonly made argument that sexual violence against men constitutes an attack on masculinity. Fundamentally, it examines how masculinity norms and expectations have shaped the men’s stories, coping strategies, and current needs. This use of a masculinity lens highlights important gaps within transitional justice, which to date has narrowly focused on violent and militarised forms of masculinity. The article thus calls for transitional justice processes to give more attention to masculinities affected by violence.},

This paper critically examines these two processes, demonstrating that despite a growing recognition of the value of linking these processes by researchers, in practice they often remain separate. It shows how certain actors have framed the post-disaster reconstruction as unrelated to post-conflict activities in order to avoid what they perceive as the risk of politicising – and thus delaying –the post-disaster reconstruction process. The paper suggests that this is a mistake. The process of post-disaster reconstruction is innately political and intricately entwined with the very same issues and activities the post-conflict reconstruction process attempted to address. Moreover, we argue that the entire process is taking place within a political context which is a product of the as-yet unresolved post-conflict polity. Any reconstruction process that does not take this into account risks being undermined by the same challenges that underpinned the country’s conflict.},

Capacity and resource constrains may pose challenges to DDRR programming in conﬂict-aﬀected contexts, but engaging former extremists, their families and communities at large mitigates the issues characteristic for conﬂict-aﬀected contexts and contributes to wider peace-building objectives.},

	abstract = {The peace-building literature widely frames corruption as a threat to the stability of states transitioning from armed conﬂict. Underlying this framing are liberal assumptions on the institutions required for long-term stability, to which corruption is seen as necessarily detrimental. In this article, I add to an emergent literature critical of this framing by examining the long-term impacts of corruption on locallevel stability in Ghorahi, Nepal. Drawing on a new dataset of 89 interviews, I demonstrate the stabilising consequences of corruption on two key aspects of Nepal’s post-2006 transition. First, I show that elite-level corruption arising from the transformation of the Maoist insurgency into the political mainstream has inadvertently contributed to the social reintegration of rank and ﬁle ex-combatants. Second, I show how a corrupt elite network in local government contributed to the cooperation between political parties – including the emerging post-conﬂict Maoist party. These elements broaden the evidence for the stabilising consequences of corruption, which is largely focused on the eﬀects of elite-led patronage and coping economies during episodes of conﬂict.},

	abstract = {The importance of IXPs to interconnect different networks and exchange trafﬁc locally has been well studied over the last few years. However, far less is known about the role IXPs play as a platform to enable large-scale content delivery and to reach a world-wide customer base. In this paper, we study the infrastructure deployment of a content hypergiant, Netﬂix, and show that the combined worldwide IXP substrate is the major corner stone of its Content Delivery Network. To meet its worldwide demand for high-quality video delivery, Netﬂix has built a dedicated CDN. Its scale allows us to study a major part of the Internet ecosystem, by observing how Netﬂix takes advantage of the combined capabilities of IXPs and ISPs present in different regions. We ﬁnd wide disparities in the regional Netﬂix deployment and trafﬁc levels at IXPs and ISPs across various local ecosystems. This highlights the complexity of large-scale content delivery as well as differences in the capabilities of IXPs in speciﬁc regions. On a global scale we ﬁnd that the footprint provided by IXPs allows Netﬂix to deliver most of its trafﬁc directly from them. This highlights the additional role that IXPs play in the Internet ecosystem, not just in terms of interconnection, but also allowing players such as Netﬂix to deliver signiﬁcant amounts of trafﬁc.},

	abstract = {Variational autoencoders (VAE) have quickly become a central tool in machine learning, applicable to a broad range of data types and latent variable models. By far the most common first step, taken by seminal papers and by core software libraries alike, is to model MNIST data using a deep network parameterizing a Bernoulli likelihood. This practice contains what appears to be and what is often set aside as a minor inconvenience: the pixel data is [0,1] valued, not \{0,1\} as supported by the Bernoulli likelihood. Here we show that, far from being a triviality or nuisance that is convenient to ignore, this error has profound importance to VAE, both qualitative and quantitative. We introduce and fully characterize a new [0,1]-supported, single parameter distribution: the continuous Bernoulli, which patches this pervasive bug in VAE. This distribution is not nitpicking; it produces meaningful performance improvements across a range of metrics and datasets, including sharper image samples, and suggests a broader class of performant VAE.},

	url = {http://arxiv.org/abs/1909.08128},
	abstract = {A number of techniques have been proposed to explain a machine learning model’s prediction by attributing it to the corresponding input features. Popular among these are techniques that apply the Shapley value method from cooperative game theory. While existing papers focus on the axiomatic motivation of Shapley values, and efﬁcient techniques for computing them, they offer little justiﬁcation for the game formulations used, and do not address the uncertainty implicit in their methods’ outputs. For instance, the popular SHAP algorithm’s formulation may give substantial attributions to features that play no role in the model. In this work, we illustrate how subtle differences in the underlying game formulations of existing methods can cause large differences in the attributions for a prediction. We then present a general game formulation that uniﬁes existing methods, and enables straightforward conﬁdence intervals on their attributions. Furthermore, it allows us to interpret the attributions as contrastive explanations of an input relative to a distribution of reference inputs. We tie this idea to classic research in cognitive psychology on contrastive explanations, and propose a conceptual framework for generating and interpreting explanations for ML models, called formulate, approximate, explain (FAE). We apply this framework to explain black-box models trained on two UCI datasets and a Lending Club dataset.},

The arabic text has been established on the basis of several manuscript copies, and it has been translated into french; a bilingual index is also provided. This treatise is one of the latest and one of the most elaborate medieval work on theoretical astronomy; it is famous today for having provided the first viable lunar model in terms of the distance Moon--Earth. Although demonstrations have been consigned to another manuscript which is now lost, we reconstruct the physical models in our mathematical commentary, and we attempt at a better historical understanding of the nascent concepts of space transformations, solid reference frames, trajectory, etc. Predictions of the models are to be compared to observations and to other contemporary models, as well as theoretical premises; in turn, when records of observations are missing, those have to be recalculated by modern means. Part of our commentary is devoted to the latitudinal movement of the five planets: Ibn al-Shatir's work on this problem belongs to a tradition initiated by Ibn al-Haytham three centuries before. Ibn al-Shatir addresses a clever criticism to the work of his predecessor Nasir al-Din al-Tusi on this problem, thus revealing a better understanding of affine rotations in space. Many other criticisms by Ibn al-Shatir, especially to the astronomers working at Maragha during the XIIIth century, also contribute to a better knowledge of their own work.},

The scientiﬁc object of the work is to examine the validity of the so-called Argument from the Poverty of the Stimulus advanced in favour of the proposition that humans have language-speciﬁc innate knowledge. I start by examining an a priori argument based on Gold’s theorem, that purports to prove that natural languages cannot be learned, and some formal issues related to the choice of statistical grammars rather than symbolic grammars. I present three novel algorithms for learning various parts of natural languages: ﬁrst, an algorithm for the induction of syntactic categories from unlabelled text using distributional information, that can deal with ambiguous and rare words; secondly, a set of algorithms for learning morphological processes in a variety of languages, including languages such as Arabic with nonconcatenative morphology; thirdly an algorithm for the unsupervised induction of a context-free grammar from tagged text. I carefully examine the interaction between the various components, and show how these algorithms can form the basis for a empiricist model of language acquisition. I therefore conclude that the Argument from the Poverty of the Stimulus is unsupported by the evidence.},

The nature of spike-based algorithms that achieve complex computations, such as object probabilistic inference, is largely unknown. Here we demonstrate that a family of high-dimensional quadratic optimization problems with non-negativity constraints can be solved exactly and efficiently by a network of spiking neurons. The network naturally imposes the non-negativity of causal contributions that is fundamental to causal inference and uses simple operations, such as linear synapses with realistic time constants and neural spike generation and reset non-linearities. The network infers the set of most likely causes from an observation using explaining away, which is dynamically implemented by spike-based, tuned inhibition. The algorithm performs remarkably well even when the network intrinsically generates variable spike trains, the timing of spikes is scrambled by external sources of noise, or the network is mistuned. This type of network might underlie tasks such as odor identification and classification.},

Many systems aim to simultaneously support different users with varying levels of domain expertise, but prior domain knowledge can affect user trust and conﬁdence in detecting system errors. While it is also known that user trust can be inﬂuenced by ﬁrst impressions with intelligent systems, our research explores the relationship between ordering bias and domain expertise when encountering errors in intelligent systems. In this paper, we present a controlled user study to explore the role of domain knowledge in establishing trust and susceptibility to the inﬂuence of ﬁrst impressions on user trust. Participants reviewed an explainable image classiﬁer with a constant accuracy and two different orders of observing system errors (observing errors in the beginning of usage vs. in the end). Our ﬁndings indicate that encountering errors early-on can cause negative ﬁrst impressions for domain experts, negatively impacting their trust over the course of interactions. However, encountering correct outputs early helps more knowledgable users to dynamically adjust their trust based on their observations of system performance. In contrast, novice users suffer from over-reliance due to their lack of proper knowledge to detect errors.},

Then, a Scanning Electron Microscope (SEM) in the so called Passive Voltage Contrast (PVC) mode allows distinguishing ‘0’ and ‘1’ bit values stored in individual memory cell. Using SEM operator-free acquisition and standard image processing technique we demonstrate the possible automating of such technique over a full memory. The presented fast, eﬃcient and low cost technique is successfully implemented on 0.35µm technology node microcontrollers and on a 0.21µm smart card type integrated circuit. The technique is at least two orders of magnitude faster than state-of-the-art Scanning Probe Microscopy (SPM) methods. Without adequate protection an adversary could obtain the full memory array content within minutes. The technique is a ﬁrst step for reverse engineering secure embedded systems.},

Until now, the standard process to communicate a proof without forcing readers to execute its script was to manually copy-paste intermediate proof states into the script, as source code comments — a tedious and error-prone exercise.

	abstract = {Even though the rebels, later turned ‘revolutionaries’, actually had an insignificant role as combatants in the violent downfall of the Gaddafi regime in Libya in 2011, they became involved in acts of war in many parts of the country in what came to resemble a civil war. Their militias flourished thanks to the lucrative financial handouts that governments paid to them. To complicate matters, additional militias sprang up in the absence of any sort of viable state/institutional control on the part of the nascent ‘state’ or an inability to restrict and monopolize the use of force. Therefore, disarmament, demobilization, reintegration and security sector reform have not been possible, and the Libyan case demonstrates the failure to emulate international best practices, thus hindering any state-building. This paper seeks to analyse the Libyan case and provide an approach and framework for dealing with the genuine causes of the current situation in order help put the appropriate disarmament, demobilization and reintegration (DDR) and security sector reform (SSR) policy in place, while simultaneously not ignoring other major, contributing factors. This study suggests that the case of Libya is unique and likely to prove challenging to both established and evolving theoretical approaches to both DDR and SSR. Experiments in the country that have ignored the holistic security sector reform will be examined and its programmes analysed to ascertain whether these have produced any effective state-run structures and mechanisms, norms and procedures, or whether they have only served to reinforce the de facto roles of militias. The article argues that unless the state-building approach is revitalized and national reconciliation made a top priority, Libya’s current debacle and instability is most likely to continue.},

These lessons are particularly salient given the advent of domain specialized hardware which make it increasingly costly to stray off of the beaten path of research ideas.

            How do people become torturers? And how do we stop that transformation? This article addresses these questions by calling on academics and practitioners to consider caring for – expressing sympathy, understanding, and working with – the figure of the “not-quite-yet” torturer. We begin by noting the globality of torture across space and regime type, and suggest that this globality indicates how torture is – very frequently – not the result of any decision or order. This is followed by a discussion of the “consciousness” of the torturer vis-à-vis (1) their paradoxical emotional scarring by their own actions, and (2) their frequent descriptions of having, indeed, never themselves “intended” to torture someone. Drawing on recent developments in the theory of consciousness, we then argue that this non-purposeful enaction of torture can be understood in terms of certain somatic markers that lead, in particular material-situational settings, to people slipping towards violence. Drawing on the theory of the emergence of violence put forward by Jonathan Luke Austin, we then sketch out more fully the process of becoming a torturer in terms of the situational and material dynamics that encourage these slippages, as well as a global circulatory system of violent knowledges through various sources that become activated in particular settings. We thus suggest that becoming a torturer is more a process of transition than of decision, before noting that this distinction is often lost in the cultural cycle of torture that emerges once torture has begun. Finally, we move to outlining the implications of this non-purposeful understanding of torture by arguing for a new preventive strategy based on the principles of ergonomics and modifying the training regimes of the most common professions from which torturers emerge (the military, the police, etc.) in order to make it harder to slip towards violence. We suggest, ultimately, that this strategy of prevention requires placing ourselves in the uncomfortable position of working to care for both the becoming-torturer and the torturers themselves, in order to help them both preserve their own humanity.},

	abstract = {Context collapse, or the flattening of multiple audiences into a single context, has been an important notion in research on privacy experiences, self-performance, and changing user practices in social media. Yet, previous research has mainly addressed context collapse in spatial rather than temporal terms. The resulting lack of an understanding of time in social media limits our conception of the social media context. The aim of this article is therefore to go beyond the spatial dimension in the current notion of “context collapse” in social media. We discuss relevant theories, empirical evidence, and technical features that address the importance of a time dimension and suggest a collapse of temporal patterns in social media. By introducing the concept of “time collapse,” we account for how context in social media may muddle the time boundary between past and present, which, in turn, can affect how users manage their identity and performance on social media. Whereas research on social media has commonly addressed self-performance and impression management, we understand self-identity as an entity in progress. We analyze the results of two empirical case studies to suggest how and why a collapse of time related to self-performance is becoming increasingly prevalent, focusing on young people and Facebook. Our analyses contribute to a new understanding of time and the prolonged self-documenting practices typical of social media. Our research offers a unique understanding of the nature and conceptualization of time that may guide future directions in the study of social media and their implications for young people.},

	abstract = {Do laws affect the beliefs and attitudes held by the public? I set up a model wherein families care about their children's beliefs, which are shaped by a combination of parental actions and the law set by society. These straightforward assumptions are sufficient to generate systematic backlash against laws – individuals move in the opposite direction of the law in an attempt to preserve the values which are important to them and are placed under threat by the law. Next, I turn to survey data from the ANES to test the implications of the model. I first focus indepth on one specific case: the state Equal Rights Amendments (ERAs), which aimed to legislate gender equality. Using a dynamic difference-in-differences identification strategy, I find robust evidence that ERA passage leads to a sharp backlash amongst men in particular, who exhibit sharply more negative attitudes toward male/female equality. This shift translates into a significant increase in Republican vote share, worsened material outcomes for women, and increased marital strife. I also test and confirm the other implications of the model – such as the fact that the backlash is passed on to the next generation and that it endures more strongly in ideologically-homogeneous communities. Next, I provide evidence against a variety of alternative mechanisms. And finally, stepping back from the ERAs, I show that virtually every major U.S. social policy law of the past half-century has induced significant backlash. Taken as a whole, these findings suggest that aggressive pushes for social change through legislation may come at a significant cost.},

Using complementary priors, we derive a fast, greedy algorithm that can learn deep, directed belief networks one layer at a time, provided the top two layers form an undirected associative memory. The fast, greedy algorithm is used to initialize a slower learning procedure that fine-tunes the weights using a contrastive version of the wake-sleep algorithm. After fine-tuning, a network with three hidden layers forms a very good generative model of the joint distribution of handwritten digit images and their labels. This generative model gives better digit classification than the best discriminative learning algorithms. The low-dimensional manifolds on which the digits lie are modeled by long ravines in the free-energy landscape of the top-level associative memory, and it is easy to explore these ravines by using the directed connections to display what the associative memory has in mind.},

While the past decade has witnessed a plethora of interventions exploring this very concept, this essay attempts to layout the evolution of the concept within the literature on Palestine. In doing so, the utility of a settler-colonial analysis will become clearer and more substantially grounded in the discursive differences between literatures on Palestine and literatures on Zionism. This distinction between literature on Palestine and literature on Zionism is an important line to draw in the midst of a violent matrix that includes the on-going Zionist settler colonial occupation of Palestine. The essay suggests that Palestine studies should refer to Indigenous studies. It argues that while the settler-colonial analysis is fitting for the study of Zionism as an ideology and its history, frameworks that grew out of Indigenous studies are a more fitting political and academic home for the study of Palestinian history.},

Drawing on textual and manuscript evidence, this paper examines the role of esotericism—religious secrecy and exclusivity—in al-Būnī’s thought and in the promulgation and early circulation of his works in Egypt and environs. It is argued that al-Būnī intended his works only for elite Sufi initiates, and that, in the century or so after his death, they indeed circulated primarily in “esotericist reading communities,” groups of learned Sufis who guarded their contents from those outside their own circles. This tendency toward esotericism, and the eventual exposure of al-Būnī’s texts to a wider readership, are contextualized in relation to broader developments in late-medieval Mediterranean culture.},

	abstract = {Anthropologists engaged in post-colonial studies are increasingly adopting an historical perspective and using archives. Yet their archival activity tends to remain more an extractive than an ethnographic one. Documents are thus still invoked piecemeal to conﬁrm the colonial invention of certain practices or to underscore cultural claims, silent. Yet such mining of the content of government commissions, reports, and other archival sources rarely pays attention to their peculiar placement and form. Scholars need to move from archive-assource to archive-as-subject. This article, using document production in the Dutch East Indies as an illustration, argues that scholars should view archives not as sites of knowledge retrieval, but of knowledge production, as monuments of states as well as sites of state ethnography. This requires a sustained engagement with archives as cultural agents of “fact” production, of taxonomies in the making, and of state authority. What constitutes the archive, what form it takes, and what systems of classiﬁcation and epistemology signal at speciﬁc times are (and reﬂect) critical features of colonial politics and state power. The archive was the supreme technology of the late nineteenth-century imperial state, a repository of codiﬁed beliefs that clustered (and bore witness to) connections between secrecy, the law, and power.},

	abstract = {In this interview, artist Akram Zaatari reflects on his longstanding work with photographic heritage in the Middle East, North Africa and the Arab diaspora, and considers the different ways in which he has used photographs to illuminate and unfold historical truths. Charting divergencies and disagreements around issues of preservation that have arisen over the years within the Arab Image Foundation (of which he is one of the founders), Zaatari points out radical gestures of preservation that return photographs to the ‘living tissue’, the ‘larger ecosystem’ and a set of affective relations from which they had become detached. The far-ranging metaphor of archaeology that the artist employs to illuminate his practice also lends itself to describe the destructive nature of certain acts of collecting premised on ‘excessive accumulation’, of which the pillage of the archaeological heritage in the Middle East and North Africa in the late 18th and early 19th centuries is an emblematic example. Collecting, however, is also a tool for writing history and the displacement of photographs serves as a crucial step to reconfigure them within new narratives. Attentive to the changing nature of photographic archives, Zaatari frees photographs from fixed and prescribed readings, bringing new perspectives to bear on them without necessarily denying those former interpretations. Additional layers of historical information can be found nestling in details accidentally captured by the camera's lens, in signs of material damage or ‘worthy’ defects. In Zaatari’s hands, digital technologies are used to emphasize, not to occlude the traces of these material histories. In the folds of the archives, hidden narratives wait to be revealed and unfolded under the loving gaze of the artist, collector and historian.},

	abstract = {Annotation. This book is a contribution to a long history of critical writing against an increasingly destructive global order marked by an excessive instrumentalisation, exploitation and degradation of the human and non-human environment, and ridden with unacceptable, but also, importantly, avoidable, forms of inequality, injustice and marginalization. It is concerned with the way anthropological critical writing in particular aims to weave oppositional concerns (anti-politics) with a search for alternatives (alter-politics): alternative economies, alternative modes of inhabiting and relating to the earth, alternative modes of thinking and experiencing otherness. If the book privileges alter-politics over oppositional politics, it is not because, as is made clear, the 'alter' moment is more important than the 'anti'. It is because a concern for alter-politics has been less prevalent.The question of 'political passion' is crucial in this conception of the alter-political. For the book argues that it is because radical political passion has been mostly directed towards anti-politics that it has come to dominate over alter-politics. This does not simply mean that political passion needs to be equally directed towards alter-politics. It also means that this passion itself needs to be a radically different kind of political passion once so directed. It is this 'alter-political passion' that I strive to create a space for throughout the work. - See more at: https://www.mup.com.au/items/153398\#sthash.1jJNCsxE.dpuf},

	abstract = {Population aging has been linked to global declines in real interest rates. A similar trend is seen for equity risk premia, which are on the rise. An existing literature can explain part of the declining trend in safe rates using demographics, but has no mechanism to speak to trends in relative returns on different assets. We calibrate a heterogeneous agent life-cycle model with equity markets and aggregate risk, and we show that aging demographics can simultaneously account for both the majority of a downward trend in the risk free rate, while also increasing the return premium attached to risky assets. This is because the life-cycle savings dynamics that have been well documented exert less pressure on risky assets as older households shift away from risk. Under reasonable calibrations we ﬁnd declines in the safe rate that are considerably larger than most existing estimates between the years 1990 and 2017. We are also able to account for most of the rise in the equity risk premium. Projecting forward to 2050 we show that persistent demographic forces will continue push the risk free rate further into negative territory, while the equity risk premium remains elevated.},

	abstract = {Lebanon has had an ambiguous approach to the more than one million Syrians seeking protection in the country since 2011. The country is neither party to the 1951 Convention relating to the Status of Refugees, nor does it have any national legislation dealing with refugees. In October 2014, Lebanon’s Council of Ministers adopted the ﬁrst comprehensive policy on Syrian displacement, one explicit goal of which is to decrease the number of Syrians in Lebanon by reducing access to territory and encouraging return to Syria. This ambition is currently being implemented through the December 2014 General Security Ofﬁce new set of entry requirements for Syrians and new rules for Syrian nationals already in Lebanon applying for and renewing their residency permits. Building on 10 months of ﬁeldwork in Lebanon, this article explores the legal status of Syrian refugees in Lebanon in light of the recent regulatory changes. It argues that these leave many refugees in a deeply precarious legal position, with an overwhelming majority of Syrian refugees present in Lebanon without legal status. In essence, this article argues that Syrians in Lebanon are left with two options: they either leave the country or stay and accept exploitation.},

	abstract = {The humanitarian crisis resulting from the Syrian conflict is estimated to be the worst so far of this century. The recent influx of refugees has now reached a point where they are equal to one quarter of Lebanon’s population, causing evident strains on its fragile economy and social structure. Syrians in Lebanon have fled from their home to seek safety, however their vulnerability is now in question as women’s and children’s rights continue to be under threat. This paper investigates the plight of Syrian and Palestinian Syrian refugees in Lebanon with an emphasis on women and children. While there are many issues confronting refugees in Lebanon, a thorough examination of this is beyond the scope of this paper. Therefore, an examination of the two most prominent issues surrounding education and violence is conducted. More specifically, this paper exposes and discusses children’s access to education in Lebanon and the short and long term effects of children forgoing education, both as economic setbacks, the lack of educated people to rebuild Syria and how education is linked to a reduction in violence against women . It will further discuss the shift in the violence that women and children are exposed to, highlighting the increase in violence that they are experiencing. The main forms of violence are manifesting in Intimate Partner Violence, early marriage, survival sex, and the threat and fear of violence from the local community.},

	abstract = {When a host state rejects the international refugee law regime, yet faces an unprecedented number of refugees, how does the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) execute its mandate to provide international protection to these refugees? This paper seeks to attend to this pertinent issue by focusing on the role and practice of UNHCR in the context of the large-scale Syrian influx to Lebanon. This country insists that it is not a country of asylum, and flatly rejects ratification of the 1951 Convention on the Status of Refugees and its 1967 Protocol. In proportion to both its geographical and population size, however, Lebanon hosts the highest number of refugees in the world. This paper argues that Lebanon’s recent policies aiming to decrease the number of Syrians in the country, by reducing access to territory and encouraging return to Syria, have heavily affected UNHCR’s own ability to execute its international protection mandate. The article seeks to explore this issue further by, on the one hand, examining UNHCR’s policies to recognise Syrians in Lebanon as refugees under international law, and, on the other, exploring its practice when it comes to registration of Syrian refugees, and the meaning of these practices for refugee protection in Lebanon.},

By exploring the complex world constituted through humanitarianism, and how that world is experienced by the many people who inhabit it, Feldman asks pressing questions about what it means for a temporary status to become chronic. How do people in these conditions assert the value of their lives? What does the Palestinian situation tell us about the world?

Instead of following systematic accounts of actors seeking global social transformation, it is shown how a Foucauldian understanding of power and resistance—here developed into a ‘politics of discomfort’—can help illuminate more situated and cautious approaches to expressions of dissent. It is illustrated how undocumented migrants, or sans-papiers, with the support of the German activist network No One Is Illegal (NOII) can assume political subjectivity to confront and resist the dominating power of sovereign state agencies that attempt to marginalise and silence acts of contestation. I argue that NOII’s practical resistance, although local, nonetheless has important dimensions ‘beyond’, as it critiques through its creative actions (global) sovereign hypocrisy, violence, and the ‘governmentality of documentation’.},

	abstract = {The term terrorism is one of the most politicized and contested concepts in the modern era. Russia has consistently framed the conflict in Chechnya as an issue of terrorism and banditry. Western policy has been inconsistent, oscillating between criticism of Russia’s excessive application of force and sympathy for Russia, in particular after 9/11 and the start of the war on terror. This article examines the debates over the nature of terrorism and explores whether terrorism is an analytically meaningful and useful concept to explain the conflict in Chechnya. It demonstrates that if we employ the most widely accepted and plausible definition of terrorism—the targeting of noncombatants—then the use of such tactics has been peripheral to the Chechen resistance, although it has gradually becoming more systematic in response to Russia’s disproportionate brutality against Chechen civilians.},

	abstract = {As a large-scale instance of dramatic collective behavior, the 2005 French riots started in a poor suburb of Paris, then spread in all of France, lasting about three weeks. Remarkably, although there were no displacements of rioters, the riot activity did travel. Access to daily national police data has allowed us to explore the dynamics of riot propagation. Here we show that an epidemic-like model, with just a few parameters and a single sociological variable characterizing neighborhood deprivation, accounts quantitatively for the full spatio-temporal dynamics of the riots. This is the ﬁrst time that such data-driven modeling involving contagion both within and between cities (through geographic proximity or media) at the scale of a country, and on a daily basis, is performed. Moreover, we give a precise mathematical characterization to the expression “wave of riots”, and provide a visualization of the propagation around Paris, exhibiting the wave in a way not described before. The remarkable agreement between model and data demonstrates that geographic proximity played a major role in the propagation, even though information was readily available everywhere through media. Finally, we argue that our approach gives a general framework for the modeling of the dynamics of spontaneous collective uprisings.},

It contends that conditions of extreme insecurity in the north of the country, and the fact that refugees in Uganda do not enjoy freedom of movement, undermine from the outset prospects for a successfully integrative and developmental approach to refugee assistance. It argues that the rights and well-being of refugees in Uganda are subordinated to the government’s wider political objectives in relation to Uganda’s internal conﬂict, and with respect to its relations with the international donor community. It concludes that, while developmental approaches promise a number of advantages in protracted refugee situations, ways must be found of ensuring that the protection needs, as well as the socioeconomic needs, of refugees are assured.},

	abstract = {This article explores the figure of the “migrant slave” that appears to conjoin antithetical notions—migration, often associated with intentionality and movement, and slavery, commonly associated with coercion and confinement. The figure of the migrant as slave has been frequently mobilized by “antitrafficking crusaders” in debates over unauthorized forms of trans-Mediterranean crossings to EUrope. Besides scrutinizing the depoliticized and dehistoricized ways in which contemporary migrant journeys have come to be associated with imaginaries of the trans-Atlantic slave trade, this article draws other, actual, comparisons between historic slavery and contemporary forms of migration. It argues that there does exist a historical resonance between the former and the latter. By remembering slave rebellions on land and at sea, the article makes the case that if one had to draw comparisons between historic slaves and contemporary migrants, beyond often crude visual associations, one would need to do so by enquiring into moments in which both enacted escape to a place of perceived freedom. It is shown that the fugitive slave escaping on the “underground railroad” resembles most closely the acts of escape via the Mediterranean and its “underground seaways” today.},

This article traces their 17 ideas of ‘neutrality’ and ‘rupture’ ethnographically, showing how their genealogy constitutes what I call the ‘radical narrative’, an interpretative framework according to which the Community perceives every action of the state. It positions this analysis within anthropological debates which see the state as produced via state-society encounters with material and imaginative dimensions, in this case, direct violence and bureaucratic inefficiency. It concludes that communities’ perceptions of the state must be taken seriously in any trust-building attempt.},

	abstract = {The use of the categories ‘refugee’ and ‘migrant’ to differentiate between those on the move and the legitimacy, or otherwise, of their claims to international protection has featured strongly during Europe’s ‘migration crisis’ and has been used to justify policies of exclusion and containment. Drawing on interviews with 215 people who crossed the Mediterranean to Greece in 2015, our paper challenges this ‘categorical fetishism’, arguing that the dominant categories fail to capture adequately the complex relationship between political, social and economic drivers of migration or their shifting significance for individuals over time and space. As such it builds upon a substantial body of academic literature demonstrating a disjuncture between conceptual and policy categories and the lived experiences of those on the move. However, the paper is also critical of efforts to foreground or privilege ‘refugees’ over ‘migrants’ arguing that this reinforces rather than challenges the dichotomy’s faulty foundations. Rather those concerned about the use of categories to marginalise and exclude should explicitly engage with the politics of bounding, that is to say, the process by which categories are constructed, the purpose they serve and their consequences, in order to denaturalise their use as a mechanism to distinguish, divide and discriminate.},

We investigate the quality of industrial-strength cardinality estimators and ﬁnd that all estimators routinely produce large errors. We further show that while estimates are essential for ﬁnding a good join order, query performance is unsatisfactory if the query engine relies too heavily on these estimates. Using another set of experiments that measure the impact of the cost model, we ﬁnd that it has much less inﬂuence on query performance than the cardinality estimates. Finally, we investigate plan enumeration techniques comparing exhaustive dynamic programming with heuristic algorithms and ﬁnd that exhaustive enumeration improves performance despite the sub-optimal cardinality estimates.},

The main idea is to use the computer for integrating plant measurements into information related to different levels of abstraction and aggregation. The basis for the data transformations is a hierachical multilevel plant description which identifies the variables and processes which are relevant to consider at the different levels. At the same time, the multilevel description provides a representation of the functional organization of the plant. This makes such a description useful for design of information displays which can be used by the operator in diagnosing disturbances.},

	abstract = {There has been significant interest in the effects of television on cognition in children, but much less research has been carried out into the effects in older adults. This study aimed to explore whether television viewing behaviours in adults aged 50 or over are associated with a decline in cognition. Using data from the English Longitudinal Study of Aging involving 3,662 adults aged 50+, we used multivariate linear regression models to explore longitudinal associations between baseline television watching (2008/2009) and cognition 6 years later (2014/2015) while controlling for demographic factors, socio-economic status, depression, physical health, health behaviours and a range of other sedentary behaviours. Watching television for more than 3.5 hours per day is associated with a dose-response decline in verbal memory over the following six years, independent of confounding variables. These results are found in particular amongst those with better cognition at baseline and are robust to a range of sensitivity analyses exploring reverse causality, differential non-response and stability of television viewing. Watching television is not longitudinally associated with changes in semantic fluency. Overall our results provide preliminary data to suggest that television viewing for more than 3.5 hours per day is related to cognitive decline.},

More general data sets of mass civilian killing do not typically enable users to isolate situations in which specific groups are deliberately targeted. The Targeted Mass Killing (TMK) data set identifies 201 TMK episodes, 1946 to 2017, with annualized information on perpetrator intent, severity, targeted groups, and new ordinal and binary indicators of genocide/politicide that can serve as alternatives to existing measures. Users are also able to construct their own indicators based on their research questions or preferred definitions. The article discusses the concept and operationalization of TMK, provides comparisons with other data sets, and highlights some of the strengths and new capabilities of the TMK data.},

	abstract = {Both Shia-centric state building and Sunni rejection of the post-2003 order are the result of cumulative processes that have unfolded over the course of the twentieth century. These developments ranged from the homogenizing nation building propagated by successive Iraqi regimes to the rise of a sect-centric Shia opposition in exile. The sectarianization of Iraq was not inevitable, but regime change in 2003 accelerated the empowerment of new and preexisting sect-centric actors. The necessary will, vision, and political skill to avert the sectarianization of Iraq were absent among Iraqi and U.S. decisionmakers at the time. The failure of the occupation forces and the new political classes to construct a functioning state that could deliver basic services exacerbated the problem. Sunni opponents of the post-2003 order became as sect-centric as the system they once derided for its Shia-centricity. Sectarianization will continue to define Iraqi politics. The spread of the self-proclaimed Islamic State across much of Iraq in 2014 represents the most extreme form of Sunni rejection,while the state-sanctioned Hashd al-Shaabi, the term given to the mass mobilization of volunteers to repel the Islamic State, embodies the most serious defense of Shia-centric state building as of late 2015.},

The true picture is discouraging: murderous bombings, ever-increasing sectarianism, and pervasive government corruption have combined to prevent progress on such crucial issues as security, healthcare, and power availability. Al-Ali contends that the ill-planned U.S. intervention destroyed the Iraqi state, creating a black hole which corrupt and incompetent members of the elite have made their own. Al-Ali maintains that, despite all efforts to divide them, Iraqis retain a strong sense of national identity, He reevaluates Iraq's relationship with itself, discusses the inspiration provided by the events of the Arab Spring, and redefines Iraq's most important struggle to regain its viability as a nation},

Since 2011, borderlands in the MENA region transformed into considerable sites of contested power by a plethora of actors. The paper points out emergent patterns of deterritorialization and reterritorialization of power in its various forms and manifestations in borderlands. The dynamics of ‘place and performance’ in the borderlands of Syria and Iraq showcase the variety of ways borders were instrumentalized under circumstances of state atrophy and their destructive tendencies for borderlands.},

Napoleon Bonaparte’s expedition to Egypt in 1798 demonstrated the military, scientific, and economic superiority of Europe.

The Arab world carries the burden of a rich religious past; because of this, it must face the complex question of secularization, which nationalism had thought to outflank with economic development directed by a state reduced to the status},

	abstract = {Soon after the 2013 military coup, state-sponsored violence and human rights abuses have begun to shake Egyptian society. The regime of president Abdel Fattah al-Sisi has attempted to rationalize them, claiming that this is the only path to save the most populous Middle Eastern country from civil unrest, terrorism, and economic decay. Al-Sisi, the former army chief during the 2013 coup, initially portrayed his ascendency to power as the only way to restore security and end the threat of terrorism. Egypt’s generals have also recognized that they cannot rely only on the promise of restoring security to justify ending of the democratic opening (2011–2013) and their heavy-handed ruling techniques. Therefore, they have also been using a web of alternative narratives to justify their approach and have been spreading these narratives using securitycontrolled public and private media institutions. Conspiracy theories, defamation campaigns, and hate speech against voices of dissent have assumed central positions in this web. Increasingly, Egypt’s generals have come to depend on notions of religious and nationalistic populism to tighten their grip on many aspects of societal life—under the pretense that they are ruling on behalf of ordinary citizens and attending to their needs.},

	abstract = {The international administration in Bosnia and Herzegovina is examined as a unique form of executive authority, sanctioned both by the parties to the war and by the international community to rule over a newly created but vulnerable state following a prolonged ethnic conflict. The High Representative effectively represents the international community rather than the people of that territory, and so lacks democratic legitimacy, but has international legitimacy based on consent of the warring parties and retroactive delegation by the UN Security Council, and also because it serves to maintain peace and security, protect human rights, and provide government in the absence of local capacity. However, it lacks accountability given that it holds a great deal of unchecked executive authority, a situation that would not be acceptable in an established democracy. The central paradox of international administrations is that they are tasked with facilitating democratic governance while they themselves lack accountability to the population they administer. When international oversight is also lacking in such administrations and when they are prolonged after the end of a conflict, serious problems of accountability can arise. The paper concludes with suggestions for accountability measures that could be put into place in future international administrations to make them more accountable, both upwardly to the international community that has appointed them, and downwardly to the people whose territory they administer.},

	abstract = {Each of four theoretical traditions in the study of American politics—which can be characterized as theories of Majoritarian Electoral Democracy, Economic-Elite Domination, and two types of interest-group pluralism, Majoritarian Pluralism and Biased Pluralism—offers different predictions about which sets of actors have how much influence over public policy: average citizens; economic elites; and organized interest groups, mass-based or business-oriented.
            A great deal of empirical research speaks to the policy influence of one or another set of actors, but until recently it has not been possible to test these contrasting theoretical predictions against each other within a single statistical model. We report on an effort to do so, using a unique data set that includes measures of the key variables for 1,779 policy issues.
            Multivariate analysis indicates that economic elites and organized groups representing business interests have substantial independent impacts on U.S. government policy, while average citizens and mass-based interest groups have little or no independent influence. The results provide substantial support for theories of Economic-Elite Domination and for theories of Biased Pluralism, but not for theories of Majoritarian Electoral Democracy or Majoritarian Pluralism.},

The article identifies the most important trends of this period for the future evolution of Jihadism, namely the ideological evolution, Jihadism as a tangible political project, internal conflict, networks and training, the coming of a new generation of ideologues and technical evolution. Similar to previous transformative periods in Afghanistan and Iraq, the argument made here is that these six trends will have a long-lasting impact on the Jihadi movement and guide the behaviour of groups and individuals for years to come.},

	abstract = {This article compares the democratic thought and practice of two influential Shi’i Muslim theologians in Iran and Iraq. It argues that a new conception of Shi’i traditional authority has been developed by senior clerics Hussain Ali Montazeri and Ali Sistani offering a new model of clerical authority closely connected to the democratic values of popular sovereignty and accountability: ‘democratic Usulism.’ Such a new paradigm envisions a form of religious legitimization that is led by elected rulers who are ultimately ‘guided’ by the sacred law of Islamic legal norms, while being held accountable to the people. The paradigm operates either as a counter-discourse to theocratic authoritarianism, currently prevalent in Iran, or as a democratic theology of citizenship and electoral participation, as in the case of Iraq. In broad terms, the two cases represent a major trend in Shi’i political theology that can be viewed as part of the global upsurge of public religions, some of which serve to counter authoritarianism (both secular and theocratic) and promote democratic rule.},

I illustrate this through American Christian Zionist performances and discourses regarding their self-imagined identity as being in a national diaspora for Israel. I argue this religious nationalism is possible because Christian Zionist performances of a national allegiance to Israeli Jews are grounded in an apocalyptic narrative of the future.},

	abstract = {Achieving peak performance in a computer system requires optimizations in every layer of the system, be it hardware or software. A detailed understanding of the underlying hardware, and especially the processor, is crucial to optimize software. One key criterion for the performance of a processor is its ability to exploit instruction-level parallelism. This ability is determined by the port mapping of the processor, which describes the execution units of the processor for each instruction. Processor manufacturers usually do not share the port mappings of their microarchitectures. While approaches to automatically infer port mappings from experiments exist, they are based on processor-specific hardware performance counters that are not available on every platform. We present PMEvo, a framework to automatically infer port mappings solely based on the measurement of the execution time of short instruction sequences. PMEvo uses an evolutionary algorithm that evaluates the fitness of candidate mappings with an analytical throughput model formulated as a linear program. Our prototype implementation infers a port mapping for Intel’s Skylake architecture that predicts measured instruction throughput with an accuracy that is competitive to existing work. Furthermore, it finds port mappings for AMD’s Zen+ architecture and the ARM Cortex-A72 architecture, which are out of scope of existing techniques.},

The study follows the co-evolution of the power system and Zionist state-building efforts in Palestine on the conceptual and material level. Conceptually, the design and construction of the system shaped Palestine as a precisely bounded entity with a distinct political, social, and economic character. Materially, the borders of the mandate were mapped onto the power system and structured an ethno-national division of capital, land, and labor. In 1948, these co-evolving forces ultimately carried over into Jewish statehood and Palestinian statelessness"--Provided by publisher},

By exploring case studies on India, Russia, Israel, Canada, Chechnya, Bosnia-Herzegovina, Belgium, Northern Ireland, Scotland, Sri Lanka, Catalonia and the Basque Country, it seeks to understand the relationship between these two key societal forms of diversity and assess the interaction between religious and nationalist perspectives. Expert contributors examine a variety of phenomena, including secular nationalism, secessionism, and polities in which religious pluralism is evolving.

Previous accounts [e.g., Cowan Acad Manage Rev 11(4):763 776, 1986)] described problem detection as the accumulation of discrepancies until a threshold was reached. In reviewing incidents taken from a variety of natural settings, we found that discrepancy accumulation did not apply to the incidents we reviewed, because (a) cues to problems may be subtle and context-dependent, and (b) what counts as a discrepancy depends on the problem-solver's experience and the stance taken in interpreting the situation. In many cases, detecting a problem is equivalent to reconceptualizing the situation. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]},

	abstract = {Schistosomiasis is a parasitic disease caused by blood flukes (Trematodes) of the genus Schistosoma (S.). It is well documented that schistosomiasis haematobium was endemic in Ancient Egypt. Infection was diagnosed in mummies 3000, 4000 and 5000 years old. Scott was the first to describe the pattern of schistosomiasis infection in Egypt. Schistosomiasis haematobium was highly prevalent (60\%) both in the Nile Delta and Nile Valley South of Cairo in districts of perennial irrigation while it was low (6\%) in districts of basin irrigation. Schistosoma mansoni infected 60\% of the population in the Northern and Eastern parts of the Nile Delta and only 6\% in the Southern part. Neither S. mansoni cases nor its snail intermediate host were found in the Nile Valley South of Cairo. The building of the Aswan High Dam -which was completed in 1967 – did not cause any increase in schistosomiasis prevalence. In 1990, a study conducted in nine governorates of Egypt confirmed the change in the pattern of schistosomiasis transmission in the Delta. There was an overall reduction in S. mansoni prevalence while Schistosoma haematobium had continued to disappear. In Middle and Upper Egypt there was consistent reduction in the prevalence of S. haematobium except in Sohag, Qena, and Aswan governorates. However, foci of S. mansoni were detected in Giza, Fayoum, Menya and Assiut. All schistosomiasis control projects implemented in Egypt from 1953 to 1985 adopted the strategy of transmission control and were based mainly on snail control supplemented by anti-bilharzial chemotherapy. In 1997, the National Schistosomiasis Control Program (NSCP) was launched in the Nile Delta. It adopted morbidity control strategy with Praziquantel mass treatment as the main component. In 1996, before the NSCP, 168 villages had S. mansoni prevalence {\textgreater}30\%, 324 villages 20–30\% and 654 villages 10–20\%. By the end of 2010, in the whole country only 29 villages had prevalence {\textgreater}3\% and none had more than 10\%.},

We identified 58 studies that examined the relation between water resources development projects and schistosomiasis, primarily in African settings. We present a systematic literature review and meta-analysis with the following objectives: (1) to update at-risk populations of schistosomiasis and number of people infected in endemic countries, and (2) to quantify the risk of water resources development and management on schistosomiasis. Using 35 datasets from 24 African studies, our meta-analysis showed pooled random risk ratios of 2·4 and 2·6 for urinary and intestinal schistosomiasis, respectively, among people living adjacent to dam reservoirs. The risk ratio estimate for studies evaluating the effect of irrigation on urinary schistosomiasis was in the range 0·02–7·3 (summary estimate 1·1) and that on intestinal schistosomiasis in the range 0·49–23·0 (summary estimate 4·7). Geographic stratification showed important spatial differences, idiosyncratic to the type of water resources development. We conclude that the development and management of water resources is an important risk factor for schistosomiasis, and hence strategies to mitigate negative effects should become integral parts in the planning, implementation, and operation of future water projects.},

Best known as the chief designer of the Old Aswan Dam, Willcocks was born and trained in India, achieved prominence with his contribution to the development of centralized and perennial irrigation in Egypt, and was hired at the end of his career by the Ottomans to restore the ancient irrigation works of Mesopotamia (which was then on the verge of being acquired by the British). In this article, I follow Willcocks’ voyages across the British Empire and show how hydraulic science moved from one colonial centre to another, and how this movement contributed to the construction and maintenance of colonialism on the ground. Often sent to newly acquired territories with ambitious projects to redesign the landscapes of property and agriculture, Willcocks and other engineers who gained their expertise in the colonies relied on lessons from their day-to-day struggle with the land and other social actors’ competing agendas to develop the daily techniques that helped establish colonial rule. As the reception of Willcocks’ work in London illustrates, it was in the metropole that engineers’ practices were translated into a colonial symbolism that had large-scale technical systems as the right tools for the job of subordinating unruly waters and Nature writ large.},

	abstract = {[From the introduction]. This study focuses on trends in relationships between Serb and Bulgarian ethno-sectarian majorities and their respective, Muslim minorities within a dynamic international systemic context. It does not focus on the Kosovar and ethnic Albanian national minority case more broadly throughout the Balkans, partly because Kosovo has already achieved de facto and will soon achieve de jure separation from Serbia, and partly because of space limitations. More attention is on the Bulgarian case as an example of relatively successful conflict resolution. For comparison purposes, the Serbian case is the Sandzak, a historic region straddling Serbia and Montenegro which is home to a concentration of Slavophone Muslims. Serbian nationalism meanwhile continues to suffer setbacks along with the post Cold War decline of intensity of Great Power willingness to support it as an ally in Southeastern Europe. After the separation of Montenegro from the confederation of Serbia and Montenegro, and the imminent separation secession of Kosovo, the Sandzak region, along with the Presovo valley with its ethnic Albanian population, is most likely to be one within Serbia, together with Voivodina, to witness more demands for autonomy, if not outright secession to join Bosnia. Whereas Voivodina’s largest ethnic minority consists of Hungarians, the Muslims of the historic region of Sandzak (part of which lies in now-independent Montenegro) has an ethno-sectarian concentration of “Bosniaks.” They tend to self-identify with the neighboring Bosniaks with their capital in Sarajevo in Bosnia- Herzegovina to the point that their preferred name is “Bosniak.”},

	isbn = {978-1-134-05968-3},
	abstract = {The presence of international missions in weak and failing states across the globe confirms that multi-lateral involvement has become a strategic imperative to secure international peace and security. With demands for democratic governance and peaceful coexistence in countries such as Afghanistan and Iraq, the questions and issues addressed in Bosnia take on greater urgency.  Focussing on Bosnia after the Dayton Peace Agreement (DPA) in 1995, this book examines the role of the international community in state building and intervention. It makes two arguments that challenge conventional, power-sharing approaches to conflict management based on group representation and elite collusion. First, the author explores the idea that effective intervention requires moving beyond the dichotomy between international imposition of state-building measures and local self-government. When compromise among the former warring parties proves impossible and domestic institutions cannot autonomously guarantee efficient policy-making, the presence of international staff in domestic institutions can guarantee further democratisation and local ownership of the peace process. Second, this book argues that the long-term transformation of conflict requires the active involvement and empowerment of domestic civil society groups. Instead of considering domestic society as a desolate blank slate, international intervention needs to build on local resources and assets, which are available even in the aftermath of a devastating war. Based on extensive field research this book will be of interest to students, scholars and policy makers struggling to understand and improve upon the dynamics of international intervention, and to those with a specific interest in the Balkans.},

	abstract = {The program of technical co-operation in Iraq, prior to the Revolution of 1958, was frequently cited as an example of the ideal Point Four program. The overthrow of the established government led naturally to questions concerning the "failure" of American technical assistance in that country. A close examination of the efforts of the United States Operations Mission (USOM) in Iraq indicates, however, both that there were some severe obstacles faced by the mission and that, despite these, the success achieved was considerable. Under the direction of the Iraq Development Board, an agency of the Iraqi Government, three kinds of aid were provided: United States technicians advised or worked with the Iraqi Government; supplies and equipment were provided for demonstration purposes; and Iraqi personnel were sent to the United States or third countries for observation or training programs. The bulk of assistance was directed towards improving agricultural methods, but much also was achieved in such areas as preventive medicine, education, and administrative improvement. To consider the Revolution as proof of failure is to misunderstand both the purposes and potential achievements of the Point Four program. Economic improvement can be made to serve political ends but is not political in itself. Also, it is a mistake to consider technical assistance as a means to support the status quo; the aim of the Point Four program is to promote the combined growth of economic improvement and political freedom.\&mdash;Ed.},

Data vendors such as Reuters transmit more than 275,000 prices per day for foreign exchange spot rates alone. Thus, high-frequency data can be a fundamental object of study, as traders make decisions by observing high-frequency or tick-by-tick data. Yet most studies published in financial literature deal with low frequency, regularly spaced data. For a variety of reasons, high-frequency data are becoming a way for understanding market microstructure. This book discusses the best mathematical models and tools for dealing with such vast amounts of data.This book provides a framework for the analysis, modeling, and inference of high frequency financial time series. With particular emphasis on foreign exchange markets, as well as currency, interest rate, and bond futures markets, this unified view of high frequency time series methods investigates the price formation process and concludes by reviewing techniques for constructing systematic trading models for financial assets.},

	abstract = {Financial institutions now face the important challenge of having to do multiple portfolio revaluations for their risk computation. The list is almost endless: from XVAs to FRTB, stress testing programs, etc. These computations require from several hundred up to a few million revaluations. The cost of implementing these calculations via a “bruteforce” full revaluation is enormous. There is now a strong demand in the industry for algorithmic solutions to the challenge. In this paper we show a solution based on Chebyshev interpolation techniques. It is based on the demonstrated fact that those interpolants show exponential convergence for the vast majority of pricing functions that an institution has. In this paper we elaborate on the theory behind it and extend those techniques to any dimensionality. We then approach the problem from a practical standpoint, illustrating how it can be applied to many of the challenges the industry is currently facing. We show that the computational effort of many current risk calculations can be decreased orders of magnitude with the proposed techniques, without compromising accuracy. Illustrative examples include XVAs and IMM on exotics, XVA sensitivities, Initial Margin Simulations, IMA-FRTB and AAD.},

There is no one single solution that would be valid for a heterogeneous world, with differing climatic, physical, social, economic and environmental conditions; varying institutional, technical and management capacities; dissimilar institutional and legal frameworks for managing water; and divergent levels of development and available technology. No single paradigm can be equally valid for all these differing conditions, and this includes dams. What is needed is a systematic approach, where the main objectives of water developments are ﬁrst identiﬁed, i.e., poverty alleviation, regional income redistribution, economic efﬁciency and environmental conservation. The best alternative available to achieve these objectives for the area in question should then be sought. The best solution may or may not include dams. In the ﬁeld of water development, small is not always beautiful and big is not always magniﬁcent. Solutions must be case-speciﬁc, and they could vary from one location to another, and even at the same location over time. Solutions may include construction of dams, large, medium or small, and/or other alternatives such as rainwater harvesting and groundwater recharge. There cannot be one, single, dogmatic, a priori answer of dams or no dams, in terms of optimal water resources development, which will suit all the different conditions of all the countries of this world, either at present, or for decades to come.},

This paper focuses speci cally on their development during the past 50 years, and points out that analyses of actual impacts of large dams are few and far between. Consequently many myths have now enshrined themselves in the literature as facts. The background to the controversy over the Aswan High Dam is analysed. While the western world has basically constructed the dams necessary, the situation is very different from the perspectives of the developing countries, where progress has left much to be desired. Climatic, technical, economic, social, environmental and institutional conditions are very different between the developed and the developing countries, and hence the approaches to water management cannot be identical for the whole world. The main issue facing the developing countries is not whether large dams have an important role to play in the coming decades, since there is really no other choice, but rather how best we can continue to improve their overall effectiveness for human welfare, eradicate poverty and preserve the environment.},

The theoretical argument is supported by a detailed historical overview of central examples of the established/outsider dichotomy throughout the evolution of the modern states system, and in-depth studies of Turkey after the First World War, Japan after the Second World War, and Russia after the Cold War"--},

Ussama Makdisi's Age of Coexistence reveals a hidden and hopeful story that counters this clichéd portrayal. It shows how a region rich with ethnic and religious diversity created a modern culture of coexistence amid Ottoman reformation, European colonialism, and the emergence of nationalism. Moving from the nineteenth century to the present, this groundbreaking book explores, without denial or equivocation, the politics of pluralism during the Ottoman Empire and in the post-Ottoman Arab world. Rather than judging the Arab world as a place of age-old sectarian animosities, Age of Coexistence describes the forging of a complex system of coexistence, what Makdisi calls the "ecumenical frame." He argues that new forms of antisectarian politics, and some of the most important examples of Muslim-Christian political collaboration, crystallized to make and define the modern Arab world. Despite massive challenges and setbacks, and despite the persistence of colonialism and authoritarianism, this framework for coexistence has endured for nearly a century. It is a reminder that religious diversity does not automatically lead to sectarianism. Instead, as Makdisi demonstrates, people of different faiths, but not necessarily of different political outlooks, have consistently tried to build modern societies that transcend religious and sectarian differences"--Provided by publisher},

The House, referred to by the villagers as the “Memory House of Atatürk,” was opened in 2014 in a Muslim village, Kocacık, with the support of the Turkish state. Through material and textual representations of Atatürk's life, the House speaks to the Turkishness and Turkish presence in the Balkans. The Turkishness, however, is imagined through the neo-Ottoman and Islamic prisms. The House thus becomes the locus of alternative interpretations of the past, and, consequently, narratives of Muslims’ identity and origin in the region. Moreover, as it is reconstructed at the nexus of the local and the transnational, the House is also called a symbol of the “politics of brotherhood” between Macedonia and Turkey. In this way, the institution embodies the reconstruction of the past not only at the local and national levels, but also at the international level.},

Yet while policy analysts have debated the factors that contribute to successful DDR programs and scholars have reasoned about the macro conditions that facilitate successful peace building, little is known about the factors that account for successful reintegration at the micro level. Using a new dataset of ex-combatants in Sierra Leone, this article analyzes the individual-level determinants of demobilization and reintegration. Past participation in an abusive military faction is the strongest predictor of difficulty in achieving social reintegration. On economic and political reintegration, we find that wealthier and more educated combatants face greater difficulties. Ideologues, men, and younger fighters are the most likely to retain strong ties to their factions. Most important, we find little evidence at the micro level that internationally funded programs facilitate demobilization and reintegration.},

	abstract = {A successful demobilization and reintegration program (DRP) for ex-combatants is the key to an effective transition from war to peace. The success of this first step following the signing of a peace accord signals the end to organized conflict and thereby provides the security necessary for people affected by war to reinvest in their lives and their country. Undertaken in a peacetime context, a DRP enables a government to restructure its public expenditure in favor of poverty-oriented programs and to consolidate peace efforts. Reinsertion and reintegration are not distinct phases independent of demobilization. Rather, they are part of a seamless web in the transition from military to civilian life, without a clear beginning or end. As reinsertion and reintegration proceed, the needs of ex-combatants change and call for different support activities. To rebuild community social fabric and engender the understanding necessary to rebuild trust, measures of national reconciliation should form part and parcel of a DRP. A successful DRP requires several integrated actions: (a) classifying ex-combatants according to need, skill level, and their desired mode of subsistence, (b) offering a basic transitional assistance package (safety net), (c) finding a way to deliver assistance simply, minimizing transition costs while maximizing benefits to ex-combatants, (d) sensitizing communities and building on existing social capital, (e) coordinating centrally yet decentralizing implementation authority to districts, and (f) connecting the DRP to ongoing development efforts by retargeting and restructuring existing portfolios.},

Starting from the obvious fact that professional intuition is sometimes marvelous and sometimes ﬂawed, the authors attempt to map the boundary conditions that separate true intuitive skill from overconﬁdent and biased impressions. They conclude that evaluating the likely quality of an intuitive judgment requires an assessment of the predictability of the environment in which the judgment is made and of the individual’s opportunity to learn the regularities of that environment. Subjective experience is not a reliable indicator of judgment accuracy.},

	abstract = {In the wake of the 2006 ‘Cartoons Affair’ which saw international protests by Muslims against the publication of cartoons depicting the Prophet Muhammad, it is clear that identity based on membership in the Islamic ummah goes far beyond simple religious afﬁliation. This essay presents a novel argument for treating the ummah (the transnational community of Muslim believers) as a nation. I begin with a theoretical treatment of the ummah as nation which employs historic and current interpretations of what constitutes nationhood. I then turn to the current state of the ummah; my ﬁndings present a potent nexus of information and communications technology (ICT), emergent elites, and Muslim migration to the West that has facilitated a hitherto impossible reiﬁcation of the ummah. I also discuss how globalisation, Western media practices, and the nature of European society allow ‘ummahist’ elites to marginalise other voices in the transnational Muslim community. Based on the global events surrounding the Danish cartoons controversy of 2005–06, I conclude that there is need to recognise ummah-based identity as more than just a profession of faith – it represents a new form of postnational, political identity which is as profound as any extant nationalism.},

In a synchronous system, there is a known fixed upper bound A on the time required for a messageto be sent from one processor to another and a known fixed upper bound \% on the relative speeds of different processors. In an asynchronous system no fixed upper bounds A and @exist. In one version of partial synchrony, fixed bounds A and Cpexist, but they are not known a priori. The problem is to design protocols that work correctly in the partially synchronous system regardlessof the actual values of the bounds A and Cp.In another version of partial synchrony, the bounds are known, but are only guaranteed to hold starting at some unknown time T, and protocols must be designed to work correctly regardlessof when time T occurs. Fault-tolerant consensusprotocols are given for various casesof partial synchrony and various fault models. Lower bounds that show in most casesthat our protocols are optimal with respect to the number of faults tolerated are also given. Our consensusprotocols for partially synchronous processors use new protocols for fault-tolerant “distributed clocks” that allow partially synchronous processorsto reach some approximately common notion of time.},

	isbn = {978-0-674-08833-7},
	abstract = {This book is a socio-spatial history of the Middle East, and uses that case to reflect more broadly on the making of the modern world. Pivoting around Bilād al-Shām (Greater Syria) - alternatingly zooming in on cities and nation-states and zooming out to neighboring countries, imperial and transnational links, and overseas diasporas - it asks: Why, how, and in which stages did well-rooted cities and regions mold a dynamic modern world economy and powerful modern states, and how were they remolded in return? Covering culture, the economy, and administration from the mid-19th to the mid-20th century in five chapters, each prefaced by one person's illustrative story, the book identifies three key developments in the late Ottoman period. Cities were transformed but remained powerful; interurban ties grew stronger; and Bilād al-Shām became more integrated. These developments did not end in 1918 but, as is shown next, deeply shaped post-Ottoman times. While quartered, Bilād al-Shām became an umbrella region for Palestine, Transjordan, Syria and Lebanon, and forced French and British rulers to coordinate policies. And while cities lionized their weight in transnational circuits as well as reimagined themselves as national places to assert their rank in new nation-states, the latter were from the start multi-urban and transnationalized spaces. Building on the Middle Eastern case, the book argues that the modern world cannot be truly grasped by studying globalization or state formation or urbanization, as many histories do. Rather, the modern world's most fundamental socio-spatial feature is what can be called transpatialization: the intertwinement of cities, regions, states, and global circuits in faster changing and more mutually transformative ways than before in history.--},

	abstract = {When President Barack Obama visited Cairo in 2009 to deliver an address to Muslims worldwide, he followed in the footsteps of countless politicians who have taken the existence of a unified global Muslim community for granted. But as Cemil Aydin explains in this provocative history, it is a misconception to think that the world's 1.5 billion Muslims constitute a single religio-political entity. How did this belief arise, and why is it so widespread? The Idea of the Muslim World searches for the intellectual origins of a mistaken notion and explains its enduring allure for non-Muslims and Muslims alike. Conceived as the antithesis of Western Christian civilization, the idea of the Muslim world emerged in the late nineteenth century, when European empires ruled the majority of Muslims. It was inflected from the start by theories of white supremacy, but Muslims had a hand in shaping the idea as well. Aydin reveals the role of Muslim intellectuals in envisioning and essentializing an idealized pan-Islamic society that refuted claims of Muslims' racial and civilizational inferiority. After playing a key role in the politics of the Ottoman Caliphate, the idea of the Muslim world survived decolonization and the Cold War, and took on new force in the late twentieth century. Standing at the center of both Islamophobic and pan-Islamic ideologies, the idea of the Muslim world continues to hold the global imagination in a grip that will need to be loosened in order to begin a more fruitful discussion about politics in Muslim societies today.--},

	shorttitle = {Nationalism},
	abstract = {For the last two centuries, nationalism has been a central feature of society and politics. Few ideologies can match its power and resonance, and no other political movement and symbolic language has such worldwide appeal and resilience. But nationalism is also a form of public culture and political religion, which draws on much older cultural and symbolic forms. Seeking to do justice to these different facets of nationalism, the second edition of this popular and respected overview has been revised and updated with contemporary developments and the latest scholarly work. It aims to provide a concise and accessible introduction to the core concepts and varieties of nationalist ideology; a clear analysis of the major competing paradigms and theories of nations and nationalism; a critical account of the often opposed histories and periodization of the nation and nationalism; and an assessment of the prospects of nationalism and its continued global power and persistence. Broad and comparative in scope, the book is strongly interdisciplinary, drawing on ideas and insights from history, political science, sociology and anthropology. The focus is theoretical, but it also includes a fresh examination of some of the main historical and contemporary empirical contributions to the literature on the subject. It will continue to be an invaluable resource for students of nationalism across the social sciences. -- Back cover},

The article will engage with ethnosymbolist interpretations on three different levels. Since ethnosymbolists present their approach as an attempt to revise the modernist analysis from within, it will ﬁrst address their critique of modernism. It will then assess the analytical contributions of ethnosymbolism, focusing in particular on four issues: the antiquity of nations and national feelings, the importance of the past for the present and the related issue of the role of elites in nation-formation, the notorious issue of resonance and the plurality of ethnic pasts. Finally, it will question the normative implications of ethnosymbolism and conclude that ethnosymbolism is more an attempt to resuscitate nationalism than to explain it.},

In this venue, first it addresses the issue of why many of the existing theoretical models are difficult to use for attending to the case of Turkish nationalism in a comparative framework. Capitalising on the ethnosymbolic understanding of ideological and ethno-cultural continuities in the formation of modern nationalisms, this study provides an analysis of points of contestation regarding the history of modern, patriotic Turkish nationalism. It then discusses the demographic and socio-cultural background of the bonding of exiled masses of Ottoman Muslims with the native Muslims of Anatolia under the banner of a revived, independent Turkish nation. The debate offered here is based on a critical evaluation of the myths and symbols of Turkish national identity within the larger context and time frame of Ottoman/Turkish history.},

	abstract = {This article consists of an analysis of ethnographic material on Afghan trading networks involved in both the export of commodities from China to a variety of settings across Eurasia and the movement of ‘refugees’ from Afghanistan to Europe. Much recent work on trading networks has deployed the concept of trust to understand the functioning of such social formations. By contrast, in this article I assess the durability of Afghan networks in three ways. First, recognition of how they are polycentric and multi-nodal. Second, how they are successful in transforming their collective aims and projects in changing shifting political and economic circumstances. Third, how they are made up of individuals able to switch their statuses and activities within trading networks over time. Furthermore, I argue that a focus on the precise ways in which traders entrust capital, people and commodities to one another, reveals the extent to which social and commercial relationships inside trading networks are frequently impermanent and pregnant with concerns about mistrust and contingency. Recognition of this suggests that scholars should focus on practices of entrustment rather than abstract notions of trust in their analyses of trading networks per se, as well as seek to understand the ways in which these practices enable actors to handle and address questions of contingency.},

It begins with the exodus of a large Ottoman population from eastern Anatolian provinces to eastern Massachusetts, and their employment in New England’s leather factories. Throughout the article, the rise of the leather business in eastern Massachusetts cities (including Peabody and Salem), the Turkish immigrants’ concentration on Peabody’s Walnut Street (which came to be called ‘‘Ottoman Street’’), the importance of kin and friends in providing practical information vital for adjusting to the new environment, and the coffee house as a response to industrial conditions are discussed at length. The author argues that, although many of the Turkish leatherworkers originated from rural backgrounds and had no experience in unionizing and striking, their quick adjustment to the industrial city and their growing awareness of labor rights was a result of lectures given within the Turkish community, changing circumstances in the old country and in the United States, such as the Balkan Wars and World War I, and their unchallenged place in the tanneries of Peabody, MA.},

Expatriate numbers grew rapidly to around 150 in the early 1970s, before declining to around twenty by 1980. During the second period of the 1980s, there were rarely more than a dozen expatriates employed, while the third period starting in 1990 has seen the ongoing engagement of increasingly large numbers of expatriates.},

Since VoIP calls may traverse untrusted networks, packets should be encrypted to ensure conﬁdentiality. However, we show that when the audio is encoded using variable bit rate codecs, the lengths of encrypted VoIP packets can be used to identify the phrases spoken within a call. Our results indicate that a passive observer can identify phrases from a standard speech corpus within encrypted calls with an average accuracy of 50\%, and with accuracy greater than 90\% for some phrases. Clearly, such an attack calls into question the efﬁcacy of current VoIP encryption standards. In addition, we examine the impact of various features of the underlying audio on our performance and discuss methods for mitigation.},

              fraternity

Within that contract not only were women “subject to men's power; it also implied complementary bonds between men;… women had no place in the new political and social order except as markers of social relations between men.”
            
            Hunt's observation recalls Sedgwick's analysis of how male bonding is mediated through the figure of woman. In nationalist discourse representing the homeland as a female body has often been used to construct a national identity based on male bonding among a nation of brothers.},

Three major decision-making models-rational choice, incremental, and organizational process-are assessed according to their appropriateness for and applicability to the “technological dimension.” This dimension is defined in terms of three major components-design, impact, and management issues. Despite a tendency of the literature to associate the rational-choice model with highly technical decisions, this study illustrates the dominance of “satisficing,” “muddling through,” and “bounded rationality” behavior for each of the major participants. The technological dimension is found to be important, but clearly secondary to the primacy of politics.},

The main function of the barrages to rise the water levels to feed the main canals of irrigation projects. Further, some barrages are functioning as a diversion structures during floods. The first built barrage and still in operation is Kut Barrage which opened in 1939, while the last one is Amarah Barrage that were opened in 2004. Some of the barrages are in good conditions, some are suffering from technical issues, and others especially at the lower reaches of Tigris and Euphrates Rivers getting insufficient maintenance. Generally, the upstream approaches need dredging of the sediments and small islands, and there is a need also for bathymetric survey of the rivers sections near barrages.},

	abstract = {Thousands of monographs, reports, and articles about radicalization have been published since 2001. With the passage of time, the “scientific community” has come to identify some of them as “milestones.” Which are they? Unlike Anja Dalgaard-Nielsen, who wrote an article in 2010 on what we know and what we don’t know about violent radicalization in Europe, the author here aims to present and discuss what everybody should know about the process of becoming radicalized. This article has four aims. The first is to present and discuss the most influential theories of radicalization leading to terrorism. This author attributes the milestones in radicalization research to the following scholars: Fathali M. Moghaddam, Silber \& Bhatt, Marc Sageman, John Horgan, Quintan Wiktorowicz, Lawrence Kuznar, Clark McCauley, Sophia Moskalenko, Donatella della Porta, Arie W. Kruglanski, Jocelyn J. B elanger, and Rohan Gunaratna. The second aim is to highlight the contribution of sociology, as an academic discipline, to the study of radicalization. To that end, the process of radicalization has been conceptualized here as a process of socialization or, more precisely, resocialization. The third aim is to present the DRIA Model of radicalization that is based on the lives of thirty-nine jihadi terrorists who succeeded in carrying out terror attacks in the West between 2004 and 2018. The fourth aim is to contribute to the debate over the “stagnation” – real or presumed –in radicalization research.},

	abstract = {A community-of-practice (CoP) approach is used to analyze rural water sustainability. In combining CoP with the capability approach (CA), a dichotomy is generated between project goals and project practices and whether they are locally or externally driven. Four possible project scenarios are developed from this framework: empowerment (local goals and practices), apprenticeship (local practices and external goals), assistencialism (external practices and local goals) and determinism (external goals and practices). A novel arrangement of indicators is used that incorporates economic (costs), environmental (natural resources) and engineering (skills) sustainability. A meta-synthesis of 23 Egyptian rural water projects indicates that sustainability potential should optimize environmental and engineering sustainability on one hand, with economic sustainability on the other. The policy implication is that managing a series of village-level water projects at a regional level best achieves both economy of scale and adequate cultivation of local practices. However, such a policy is only possible if national institutions enable decentralized regional governance. If institutions resist decentralization, institutional incentives are likely necessary to ensure a more enabling environment. Copyright © 2010 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd and ERP Environment.},

However, the way control was sought in African irrigation projects was different from Asian colonies. This paper traces the origins of colonial approaches to irrigation development in Africa and the continuities between colonial and post-colonial approaches. The Kano River Project in Nigeria, part of a larger irrigation development program from the late 1960s and early 1970s, serves as a typical example of a post-colonial irrigation system in which engineers drew upon colonial experiences. The Dutch engineers responsible for developing the system applied technologies from the Netherlands East Indies to regulate water flows in the system. At the same time, they engaged in a debate on how to organize farmers in the project to ensure efficient and rational use of water in irrigated farming. They joined project managers in viewing strong control over farmer production – a central feature of African colonial irrigation projects – as key to success. However, given the social conditions in the Kano area, particularly landownership, this strong control proved difficult to realize.},

Its environmental perspective shows how a shared reliance on natural resource management bound together extremely rural regions of the Ottoman Empire like Fayyum with centers of power in Istanbul and Cairo. It seeks to make two historiographical interventions. First, its focus on irrigation reveals how the centerperiphery model of early modern empires fails to capture the complexity of relationships that rural regions of the Ottoman Empire maintained with other provinces and towns both in the empire and beyond. Water in Fayyum grew food that forged connections of commodity movement with areas of the Mediterranean and Red Seas. Second, through an examination of such intraimperial and transregional ties, this article argues that Egyptian peasants held much of the power in these relationships.},

The nonefﬂuent-irrigated plot served as the control and provided reference “background” values. Total metals at different soil depths were analyzed by acid digestion, and EDTA-extractable metals were analyzed as available fraction. Results show that soil pH values were signiﬁcantly (p {\textless} 0.05) lowered in plots with 20-year irrigation to a depth of 140 cm, while EC was elevated for all three plots compared with control. OM, TC and TN contents increased in the top 10-cm soil layers in plots with 8- and 20-year efﬂuent irrigation. Irrigation with efﬂuents also increased both the total and EDTA-extractable metals in the ﬁelds. It showed that long-term efﬂuent irrigation could be of agricultural interest due mainly to its organic matter concentrations and nutrients input, however, trace contaminants such as heavy metals in the upper horizons may be accumulated, which may eventually lead to deterioration of soil and groundwater quality and affect the sustainability of land-based disposal of efﬂuent.},

Sixty-six groundwater samples were collected from shallow tube wells and analyzed for pH, total dissolved solids (TDS), electrical conductivity (EC), calcium, magnesium, sodium, potassium, chloride, bicarbonate, carbonate, sulfate and nitrate. Groundwater suitability for drinking was evaluated based on the World Health Organization (WHO) and Iraqi standards, whereas suitability of groundwater for irrigation was evaluated based on various hydrochemical parameters and methods, such as sodium adsorption ratio (SAR), residual sodium carbonate (RSC), sodium percentage (\%Na), United States salinity diagram, Wilcox’s diagram and magnesium hazards (MH). Results showed that the urban area of Baghdad is highly affected by the anthropogenic sources. Based on Piper diagram, the groundwater in the study area are classified into two water types (NaCl and CaCl), indicating high-salinity water. Gibbs ratio indicates that the majority of the groundwater in the study area is affected by the evaporation process. Furthermore, the ion exchange process revealed that 85\% of the groundwater samples indicate chloro-alkaline disequilibrium. Moreover, it was found that all the groundwater samples are unsuitable for both drinking and irrigation purposes.},

It finds long-distance nationalism, target selection, and training locations to be inadequate explanations, despite their utility in other cases where ethnic diaspora associations converge with jihadist activity. The marginalisation and disadvantage faced by Lebanese-Australian Muslims proved to be an influence, but could not account for the difference between the small numbers involved in jihadism and the tens of thousands facing comparable social circumstances. The most direct explanation for this phenomenon proved to be the intimate personal connections between the radical networks straddling the two countries. A network analysis is therefore conducted, distinguishing between operational and social connections, in order to give greater insight into this threat.},

We explore this question through original data collection on German foreign ﬁghters in Syria and Iraq, and test three sets of hypotheses that revolve around socioeconomic integration, online radicalization, and social network mobilization. We conduct link analysis to map the network of German foreign ﬁghters prior to their mobilization, and marshal evidence to assess the validity of competing explanations. We ﬁnd only modest support for the integration deﬁcit hypothesis, and meager support for the social media radicalization theory. Instead, the preponderance of evidence suggests that interpersonal ties largely drive the German foreign ﬁghter phenomenon. Recruitment featured clustered mobilization and bloc recruitment within interconnected radical milieus, leading us to conclude that peer-to-peer networks are the most important mobilization factor for German foreign ﬁghters.},

These are collectively known, whether for good or bad, as ‘‘de-radicalization programs.’’ However, and despite their popularity, data surrounding even the most basic of facts about these programs remains limited. This article presents an overview of the results of a one-year pilot study of select de-radicalization programs and investigates critical issues surrounding assessment of their effectiveness and outcomes. We argue that Multi Attribute Utility Technology (MAUT) may offer promise for future empirical assessment of what we prefer to designate ‘‘terrorism risk reduction initiatives.’’ Perhaps less obviously, and until more data surrounding the efficacy of such initiatives becomes available, MAUT may also provide a conceptual basis for planning, evaluating, and guiding the development of future such initiatives and may have the unanticipated consequence of facilitating progress by encouraging greater exploration of efforts to change behavior from other contexts.},

	abstract = {Although there has recently been a considerable increase in research into lone actor terrorism, one of the main areas that remains understudied is that of target selection. The lack of empirically driven studies that can guide prevention measures is a notable oversight. This paper applies methods from environmental criminology to examine the residence-to-attack journeys of 122 lone terrorist acts in the U.S and Europe. The distance decay eﬀect was evident, and signiﬁcant diﬀerences were found between subgroups. Individuals were more likely to travel further if a) they were in the U.S, b) they had links to a wider network, c) they had a single-issue ideology, d) they attacked an iconic target, e) they attacked a symbolic building, or f) they used a bomb as their main weapon. A few case studies are discussed which highlight a need to conduct further research that considers the whole nodal network of an individual. The ﬁndings suggest that distance can be put forward as a constraining factor on lone actor target selection and provide support for the notion that the spatial decision making of terrorists is similar to traditional criminals.},

The issue of returnees, and appropriate national and international responses to potential threats, has become a preeminent security concern of the 2010s, impacting policies on everything from refugees to whether to permit ISIS ﬁghters to leave the theater of conﬂict alive. This article attempts to illuminate these contentious debates through a new data set of Lags in Attack Times of Extremist Returnees (LATER) that examines 230 jihadi returnees to Western countries. The data indicate that the majority of attempted attacks occur within one year, with a median lag time of just four months. Prison appears to play no role in lag times. Our ﬁndings indicate that security and reintegration eﬀorts should be targeted within the critical six months after return, which diminishes the risk of attack considerably.},

I investigate the impact of statecapacity on terrorist group termination by exploring the waysterrorist groups respond to increasing state capacity. I argue thatincreasing state capacity might lead to a set of responses fromthe terror group in a way that it might induce the group to producemore terrorist violence to show that the group can still persist. Itmay also encourage the group to provide positive and negativeincentives to its constituents in order to rehabilitate its physicalcapacity to operate, and to prevent a shift of popular support a wayfrom the group towards to the government. Thus, such responsesof the group will decrease the likelihood of its terror campaign. Ialso expect that these arguments are especially relevant for ethnicor religious terror groups.

	abstract = {Computational Social Science emerged as a highly technical and popular discipline in the last few years, owing to the substantial advances in communication technology and daily production of vast quantities of personal data. As per capita data production significantly increased in the last decade, both in terms of its size (bytes) as well as its detail (heartrate monitors, internet-connected appliances, smartphones), social scientists’ ability to extract meaningful social, political and demographic information from digital data also increased. A vast methodological gap exists in ‘computational international relations’, which refers to the use of one or a combination of tools such as data mining, natural language processing, automated text analysis, web scraping, geospatial analysis and machine learning to provide larger and better organized data to test more advanced theories of IR. After providing an overview of the potentials of computational IR and how an IR scholar can establish technical proficiency in computer science (such as starting with Python, R, QGis, ArcGis or Github), this paper will focus on some of the author’s works in providing an idea for IR students on how to think about computational IR. The paper argues that computational methods transcend the methodological schism between qualitative and quantitative approaches and form a solid foundation in building truly multi-method research design.},

The Islamic State movement does not share this perception, and its strategists blamed its early failures during the U.S. occupation on a ﬂawed understanding of tribal dynamics. This paper traces the political, ideological, and structural changes the leaders of the Islamic State movement made to adapt its approach toward the Sunni tribes of Iraq and later Syria, in order to develop a deeper base of popular support for its caliphate project. The group’s study of the tribes was done by a new tribal engagement oﬃce that put into motion an ethnographic study of tribal networks in key areas. There is evidence that the inspiration for this change came from its opponents. The Islamic State movement used these new insights to win a greater level of inﬂuence in rural areas, which in turn inﬂuenced its success in 2014. This research supports the idea that insurgency and counterinsurgency success often depend on which side is best at the incorporation of cultural and societal knowledge into policy and strategy.},

Validated and standardized cross-cultural measures can help identify protective capacities and vulnerabilities toward violent extremism for young people. Because drivers for violent extremism are multi-factorial, a measure of resilience cannot be used to predict who will and will not commit acts of terror. Instead, its purpose is to track the multiple forms of capital available to youth at risk of adopting violence to resolve ideological, religious and political grievances, and to use this data to inform interventions that increase young people’s capacity to resist violent extremism’s push and pull forces. In this study, we developed such a measure, using data from 200 Australian and 275 Canadian participants aged eighteen–thirty years old. Following exploratory and conﬁrmatory factor analysis, a fourteen-item measure emerged consisting of ﬁve factors: cultural identity and connectedness; bridging capital; linking capital; violence-related behaviors, and violence-related beliefs. The Building Resilience against Violent Extremism (BRAVE) measure was found to have good internal reliability (α = .76), correlating in expected directions with related measures. The BRAVE shows promise for helping understand young people’s resilience to violent extremism.},

	abstract = {Improvements have been made in identifying the prevalence of risk factors/indicators for violent extremism. A consistent problem is the lack of base rates. How to develop base rates is of equal concern. This study has two aims: (i) compare two methods for developing base rates; the Unmatched Count Technique (UCT) and direct questioning, (ii) generate base rates in a general population sample and compare these to a sample of lone-actor terrorists (n = 125). We surveyed 2108 subjects from the general population. Participants were recruited from an online access panel and randomly assigned to one of three conditions; direct survey, control, or UCT. Survey items were based on a lone-actor terrorist codebook developed from the wider literature. Direct questioning was more suitable under our study conditions where UCT resulted in deflation effects. Comparing the base rates identified a number of significant differences: (i) lone-actor terrorists demonstrated propensity indicators related to a cognitive susceptibility, and a crime- and/or violence-supportive morality more often; the general sample demonstrated protective factors more often, (ii) lone-actor terrorists demonstrated situational indicators related to a crime- and/or violence-supportive morality more often, whereas the general sample experienced situational stressors more often, (iii) lone-actor terrorists demonstrated indicators related to exposure to extremism more often. Results suggest there are measurable differences in the prevalence of risk factors between lone-actor terrorists and the general population. However, no single factor “predicts” violent extremism. This bears implications for our understanding of the interrelation of risk and protective factors, and for the risk assessment of violent extremism.},

As part of disarming youth combatants, the linkages between reintegration outcomes and possible rerecruitment into radical and extremist violence must be better understood to mitigate such risks. In our analysis, the policies guiding reintegration of child soldiers and youth should be better attuned to the relationship between recruitment motivations and reintegration outcomes, and must be approached from a political lens rather than a purely technical one. The risk of radicalization and involvement in violent extremism is ultimately a structural challenge, which needs to address root causes of recruitment rather than trying to find a solution through a band-aid approach of stopgap reintegration assistance.},

	abstract = {Since the fall of Saddam Hussein in 2003, the name of Ayatollah Ali al-Sistani, the Grand Shiʿi cleric, has come to prominence. Sistani emerged as a key player in the processes that constituted and sustained the post-2003 Iraqi political order, as manifested in key events such as the writing of constitution or the mobilization against the Islamic State (I.S.). Nevertheless, Sistani did not have an official position in Iraq. Unlike the Iranian experience after the 1979 revolution which institutionalized the leading position of faqih (jurist), the Iraqi constitution set Iraq as a democratic, parliamentary state whose religious leaders held no formal offices. Indeed, Sistani rejected the Iranian model as unfit for Iraq’s conditions and societal fabric. Thus, given the absence of a constitutional status for Sistani, how do we understand his authority in Iraq? This article argues that although Sistani’s authority has not been constitutionalized, it was indirectly and roughly ‘formalized’ through practices and laws adopted after 2003. This formalization established a unique and unprecedented relationship between the state and the Shiʿi religious authority in the form of arrangements that, to a degree, blurred the lines between formality and informality and created a shared space of governance.},

	abstract = {States are believed to be the paradigmatic instances of legitimate political authority. But is their prominence justiﬁed? The classic concept of state sovereignty predicts the danger of a fatal deadlock among conﬂicting authorities unless there is an ultimate authority within a given jurisdiction. This scenario is misguided because the notion of an ultimate authority is conceptually unclear. The exercise of authority is multidimensional and multiattributive, and to understand the relations among authorities we need to analyse this complexity into its different aspects. Instead of ultimate authorities we can have actors endowed with superior authority over others in one regard, but not necessarily in another. And this limited superiority is sufﬁcient for resolving conﬂicts. There is no need for ultimate authorities. Having discarded the notion of sovereignty we can embrace a different conception of legitimate authority, one that is not interested in the pedigree of actors, but in their capacity to serve its subjects. If states wish to retain their central role in the domain of political authority, they will have to earn it.},

	abstract = {Rationalist research expects that groups claim credit for terrorism. Yet, the vast majority of attacks are not claimed. Of the unclaimed attacks, about half are attributed to a speciﬁc group. What factors impact claiming decisions? While extant literature largely treats claiming as binary—either claimed or not—the present study disaggregates claiming decisions further to also consider attacks with attributions of credit but no claim, using data from 160 countries between 1998 and 2016. Both attack-level and situational factors impact claiming decisions. Disaggregating claiming behavior shows meaningful diﬀerences. Speciﬁcally, competitive environments and suicide attacks increase claims but not attributions. Higher fatalities in general increase both claims and attributions, but when the target is civilian attributions decrease with a high body count whereas claims increase. Further, while the directional impact of other variables is the same, the magnitude of their eﬀects vary between claims and attributions. Results are robust across modeling speciﬁcations. Findings demonstrate that our understanding of claiming behaviors is limited when claiming is treated as dichotomous. This study provides further insight into factors that impact claiming decisions for terrorism. Results can address data issues in academic research and inform counterterrorism responses.},

This paper reviews the ongoing changes, and considers the potential impact of two strands of the trade policy debate on the United States labour market. First, we consider policy decisions that may impact the location decision of multinational enterprises, especially within the context of the renegotiation of NAFTA. Second, we review the policy debate related to the steel industry, and the potential channels through which an import tariff on steel imports may impact the labour market.},

@article{deeks_-territoriality_2015,
	title = {The un-territoriality of data},
	volume = {125},
	issn = {00440094},
	abstract = {Territoriality looms large in our jurisprudence, particularly as it relates to the government’s authority to search and seize. Fourth Amendment rights turn on whether the search or seizure takes place territorially or extraterritorially; the government’s surveillance authorities depend on whether the target is located within the United States or without; and courts’ warrant jurisdiction extends, with limited exceptions, only to the borders’ edge. Yet the rise of electronic data challenges territoriality at its core. Territoriality, after all, depends on the ability to define the relevant “here” and “there,” and it presumes that the “here” and “there” have normative significance. The ease and speed with which data travels across borders, the seemingly arbitrary paths it takes, and the physical disconnect between where data is stored and where it is accessed critically test these foundational premises. Why should either privacy rights or government access to sought-after evidence depend on where a document is stored at any given moment? Conversely, why should State A be permitted to unilaterally access data located in State B, simply because technology allows it to do so, without regard to State B’s rules governing law enforcement access to data held within its borders? This Article addresses these challenges. It explores the unique features of data and highlights the ways in which data undermines longstanding assumptions about the link between data location and the rights and obligations that should apply. Specifically, it argues that a territorial-based Fourth Amendment fails to adequately protect “the people” it is intended to cover. Conversely, the Article warns against the kind of unilateral, extraterritorial law enforcement that electronic data encourages—in which nations compel the production of data located anywhere around the globe, without regard to the sovereign interests of other nations.},

	abstract = {The militarization and politicization of humanitarian efforts have led to diminishing effectiveness on the ground and greater dangers for humanitarian workers, leaving humanitarian action in a state of crisis. Without a vigorous restatement of the principles of humanitarianism and a concerted effort by the international community to address the causes of this crisis, humanitarian action will, as this report concludes, progressively become a tool selectively used by the powerful and possibly fail in its global mission of protecting and restoring the dignity of human life. About the AuthoR Søren Jessen-Petersen is a former assistant high commissioner for refugees in the office of the UN High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) and UN special representative for Kosovo. He has served UNHCR in Africa and the Balkans as well as at its headquarters in Geneva and New York. He is currently teaching migration and security at the 2301 Constitution Ave., NW • Washington, DC 20037 • 202.457.1700 • fax 202.429.6063 Summary With the end of the Cold War, internal conflicts targeting civilian populations proliferated. As • international political institutions struggled to figure out how to deal with these conflicts, humanitarian action often became a substitute for decisive political action or, more worryingly, was subsumed under a political and military agenda. The increasing militarization and politicization of humanitarian efforts have led to growing • ineffectiveness of humanitarian action on the ground and greater dangers for humanitarian workers. Without a vigorous restatement of the principles of humanitarianism, humanitarian action will remain in a state of crisis and continue to be a selective tool for the powerful and hence fail in its global mission of protecting and restoring the dignity of human life. There are six main causes of the humanitarian crisis, which first began to manifest itself • in the former Yugoslavia and Kosovo and later in Afghanistan and Iraq. These causes are principally structural and operational in nature. The new post–Cold War types of conflict have thrown humanitarian workers and organiza- • tions into the middle of conflicts, with a constant risk of being perceived as taking sides. Many humanitarian agencies and their donors too easily and uncritically accept the condi- • tions for involvement set by the military in those increasingly frequent operations where security forces are part of the integrated response to a crisis. This problem is aggravated by the fact that key military forces often come from the countries that are also donors to the humanitarian organizations. As recent events in the Arab world demonstrate, there can be no stability if human security • is not protected. The main protection responsibility is the legal protection of the displaced and refugees. Today, humanitarian staff is often obliged to provide physical protection and assistance in the midst of conflict zones. There are far too many humanitarian organizations present in new and major emergencies. • For example, in the aftermath of the 2010 earthquake in Haiti, there were more than nine hundred international nongovernmental organizations (NGOs) on the ground.},

	abstract = {A major problem in China's legal reform efforts has been ensuring effective legal and regulatory implementation, enforcement and compliance. In areas ranging from the enforcement of civil judgments 1 and intellectual property 2 , to environmental protec-tion 3 and food safety 4 , the phenomenon that " enforcement is difficult " (zhixing nan) remains prominent. The Chinese leadership has recognized this, identifying the im-provement of implementation and compliance mechanisms as a key component of the legal reform agenda outlined at the 4 th Plenum of 2014 5 . Partly, subsequent re-form measures have focused on the incremental improvement of existing judicial and administrative mechanisms. A revision of the Administrative Litigation Law, combined with directives to the courts to accept more administrative cases, led to a considerable increase in the number of administrative cases accepted 6 . The institu-tion of circuit appeals courts reduced the dependence of the judiciary on local gov-ernments, while changes to the case filing system reduced the discretion courts had to accept and reject cases – a process often infused with issues of politics and corrup-tion 7 . At the same time, the leadership has also explored the development of novel, tech-nology-driven tools for social control, to supplement traditional means of governing state and society. The high priority of forestalling threats to the integrity of China's political system have fuelled an increasingly powerful security state 8 . Surveillance and monitoring have become pervasive across China, particularly in politically sen-sitive areas such as Tibet and Xinjiang. Technology is increasingly introduced into the judicial system, to enhance the effectiveness of trial processes 9 , and increase the},

	shorttitle = {Snakes on a {Plane}},
	url = {http://arxiv.org/abs/2001.11564},
	abstract = {There is increasing evidence that a substantial fraction of Milky Way satellite galaxies align in a rotationally-supported plane of satellites, a rare conﬁguration in cosmological simulations of galaxy formation. It has been suggested that other Milky Way substructures (namely young halo globular clusters and stellar/gaseous streams) similarly tend to align with this plane, accordingly dubbed the Vast Polar Structure (VPOS). Using systemic proper motions inferred from Gaia data, we ﬁnd that globular cluster orbital poles are not clustered in the VPOS direction, though the population with the highest VPOS membership fraction is the young halo clusters (∼30\%). We additionally provide a current census of stellar streams, including new streams discovered using the Dark Energy Survey and Gaia datasets, and ﬁnd that stellar stream normals are also not clustered in the direction of the VPOS normal. We also ﬁnd that, based on orbit modeling, there is a likely association between NGC 3201 and the Gjöll stellar stream and that, based on its orbital pole, NGC 4147 is likely not a Sagittarius globular cluster. That the Milky Way’s accreted globular clusters and streams do not align in the same planar conﬁguration as its satellites suggests that the plane of satellites is either a particularly stable orbital conﬁguration or a population of recently accreted satellites. Neither of these explanations is particularly likely in light of other recent studies, leaving the plane of satellites problem as one of the more consequential open problems in galaxy formation and cosmology.},

	abstract = {In the two decades following World War II, the nation-state was globally established as the normal form of the modern state. This normative idea was acknowledged in the right of self-determination of nations. The enemies of national liberation were colonialism and racism. The anticolonial nationalism of Asia and Africa also shared with the Marxism of the Third International a distinction betwen the ‘‘bad nationalism’’ of the Western capitalist countries and the ‘‘good nationalism’’ of the anticolonial movements. It is now being claimed that the world order based on equally sovereign nation-states has fundamentally changed. This essay examines these arguments. It concludes that there is no ‘‘empire’’ based on deterritorialized authority. On the other hand, the normalization of nation-states implies the gradation and ranking of nations with some claiming the power to declare others exceptions to the rule of sovereign equality. Further, within nation-states, the populist politics of ethnic identity can undermine as well as bolster the ideology of nationalism. Neither imperialism nor nationalism has come to an end.},

	abstract = {Neither nationalism nor ethnicity is vanishing as part of an obsolete traditional order. Both are part of a modem set of categorical identities invoked by elites and other participants in political and social struggles. These categorical identities also shape everyday life, offering both tools for grasping pre-existing homogeneity and difference and for constructing specific versions of such identities. While it is impossible to dissociate nationalism entirely from ethnicity, it is equally impossible to explain it simply as a continuation of ethnicity or a simple reflection of common history or language. Numerous dimensions of modem social and cultural change, notably state building (along with war and colonialism), individualism, and the integration of large-scale webs of indirect relationships also serve to make both nationalism and ethnicity salient. Nationalism, in particular, remains the pre-eminent rhetoric for attempts to demarcate political communities, claim rights of self-determination and legitimate rule by reference to “the people” of a country. Ethnic solidarities and identities are claimed most often where groups do not seek “national” autonomy but rather a recognition internal to or cross-cutting national or state boundaries. The possibility of a closer link to nationalism is seldom altogether absent from such ethnic claims, however, and the two sorts of categorical identities are often invoked in similar ways.},

	abstract = {Online social networks, such as Facebook and twitter, are a growing phenomenon in today's world, with various platforms providing capabilities for individuals to collaborate through messaging and chatting as well as sharing of content such as videos and photos. Most, if not all, of these platforms are based on centralized computing systems, meaning that the control and management of the systems lies in the hand of one provider, which must be trusted to treat the data and communication traces securely. While users aim for privacy and data sovereignty, often the providers aim to monetize the data they store. Even, federated privately run social networks require a few enthusiasts that serve the community and have, through that, access to the data they manage. As a zero-trust alternative, peer-to-peer (P2P) technologies promise networks that are self organizing and secure-by-design, in which the final data sovereignty lies at the corresponding user. Such networks support end-to-end communication, uncompromising access control, anonymity and resilience against censorship and massive data leaks through misused trust. The goals of this survey are three-fold. Firstly, the survey elaborates the properties of P2P-based online social networks and defines the requirements for such (zero-trust) platforms. Secondly, it elaborates on the building blocks for P2P frameworks that allow the creation of such sophisticated and demanding applications, such as user/identity management, reliable data storage, secure communication, access control and general-purpose extensibility, features that are not addressed in other P2P surveys. As a third point, it gives an overview of proposed P2P-based online social network applications, frameworks and architectures. In specific, it explores the technical details, inter-dependencies and maturity of the available solutions.},

Simple examples are provided to illustrate new material and exercises are included at the end of most sections. Noteworthy topics include: an extensive discussion of convergence tests for infinite series, Wallis’s formula and Stirling’s formula, proofs of the irrationality of π and e and a treatment of Newton’s method as a special instance of finding fixed points of iterated functions.},

	abstract = {This essay seeks to articulate the process by which sacrifice took on new meanings, symbols, and practices in the context of the war in Afghanistan. It does so by examining five acts and the ‘axial figures’ associated with each of these acts, the first of which centers on the early efforts of Afghan political parties to change the focus of popular esteem from brave deeds to heroic deaths and the axial figure of veneration from the Warrior to the Martyr. The second act is associated with ‘Abdullah ‘Azzam who infused the figure of the Martyr with a sanctity long associated with the Sufi Saint by documenting miracles observed during and after the death of Afghan Arabs who died in the Afghan jihad. The third act involves the Taliban’s deployment of public rituals that altered the focus of sacrificial violence from collective veneration of the Martyr to the punishment of criminals who had defiled the purity of the jihad. The fourth act is associated with Osama Bin Laden who exploited the potential of using bodies as weapons of mass destruction, in the process turning the figure of the Suicide Bomber into one of the key symbols of our age. The fifth and final act discussed here involves the rise of the Islamic State and its synthesis of diverse forms of sacrificial violence, expanding and recasting these elements in a symbolic register derived from popular media and centered around the figure of the Slaughterer.},

In the event of a process or system failure, applications rely on persistent techniques to provide consistent storage of data in non-volatile memory (NVM). For most of these techniques, consistency is ensured through logging of updates, with consequent intensive cache line flushing and persistent fences necessary to guarantee correctness. Undo log based approaches require store interposition and persistence fences before each in-place modification. Redo log based techniques can execute transactions using just two persistence fences, although they require store and load interposition which may incur a performance penalty for large transactions. So far, these techniques have been difficult to integrate with known memory allocators, requiring allocators or garbage collectors specifically designed for NVM.},

However, evidence shows that the two trends are largely independent. A detailed analysis of IQ trends on the Raven's Progressive Matrices tests in Britain dramatizes the poverty of the nutrition hypothesis. A multiple factor hypothesis that operates on three levels is offered as an alternative instrument of causal explanation. The Raven's data show that over the 65 years from circa 1942 to the present, taking ages 5-15 together, British school children have gained 14 IQ points for a rate of 0.216 points per year. However, since 1979, gains have declined with age and between the ages of 12-13 and 14-15, small gains turn into small losses. This is confirmed by Piagetian data and poses the possibility that the cognitive demands of teen-age subculture have been stagnant over perhaps the last 30 years. © 2009 Elsevier B.V.

As former exiles who have returned to their country of origin are no longer refugees, some government agencies need to organize the reception of, and provide assistance to, returnees. But without long-term planning, ad hoc committees are unable to be effective facilitators of the reintegration process. The article suggests a list of major elements necessary for an effective reintegration programme, and argues that governments should focus on the institutional mechanism of programme management, including the creation of a responsible agency or agencies. The management structure should be based in the National Planning Ministry of government. Establishment of an effective mechanism would be likely to inspire donor confidence; and ‘homecoming’ would no longer be a nightmare for potential returnees trying to reintegrate.},

	abstract = {Fiqh (; Arabic: فقه‎ [fɪqh]) is Islamic jurisprudence.  Fiqh is often described as the human understanding of the sharia, that is human understanding of the divine Islamic law as revealed in the Quran and the Sunnah (the teachings and practices of the Islamic prophet Muhammad and His companions). Fiqh  expands and develops Shariah through interpretation (ijtihad) of the Quran and Sunnah by Islamic jurists (ulama) and is implemented by the rulings (fatwa) of jurists on questions presented to them. Thus, whereas sharia is considered immutable and infallible by Muslims, fiqh is considered fallible and changeable. Fiqh deals with the observance of rituals, morals and social legislation in Islam as well as political system. In the modern era, there are four prominent schools (madh'hab) of fiqh within Sunni practice, plus two (or three) within Shi'a practice. A person trained in fiqh is known as a faqīh (plural fuqaha).Figuratively, fiqh means knowledge about Islamic legal rulings from their sources and deriving religious rulings from their sources necessitates the mujtahid (an individual who exercises ijtihad) to have a deep understanding in the different discussions of jurisprudence. A faqīh must look deep down into a matter and not suffice himself with just the apparent meaning, and a person who only knows the appearance of a matter is not qualified as a faqīh.The studies of fiqh, are traditionally divided into Uṣūl al-fiqh (principles of Islamic jurisprudence, lit. the roots of fiqh), the methods of legal interpretation and analysis; and Furūʿ al-fiqh (lit. the branches of fiqh), the elaboration of rulings on the basis of these principles. Furūʿ al-fiqh is the product of the application of Uṣūl al-fiqh and the total product of human efforts at understanding the divine will.

As core-counts increase, the overhead of TLB synchronization likewise increases and hinders scalability, whereas existing software optimizations that attempt to alleviate the problem (like batching) are lacking. We address this problem by revising the TLB synchronization subsystem. We introduce several techniques that detect cases whereby soon-to-be invalidated mappings are cached by only one TLB or not cached at all, allowing us to entirely avoid the cost of synchronization. In contrast to existing optimizations, our approach leverages hardware page access tracking. We implement our techniques in Linux and ﬁnd that they reduce the number of TLB invalidations by up to 98\% on average and thus improve performance by up to 78\%. Evaluations show that while our techniques may introduce overheads of up to 9\% when memory mappings are never removed, these overheads can be avoided by simple hardware enhancements.},

Later research has complicated this picture, offering mixed evidence about how technology-mediated communication affects users. With the dawn of social network sites, this issue is more important than ever. A close examination of the extensive body of research on social network sites suggests that conflicting results can be reconciled by a single theoretical approach: the interpersonal-connection-behaviors framework. Specifically, we suggest that social network sites benefit their users when they are used to make meaningful social connections and harm their users through pitfalls such as isolation and social comparison when they are not. The benefits and drawbacks of using social network sites shown in existing research can largely be explained by this approach, which also posits the need for studying specific online behaviors in future research.},

Mull can work with code written in any programming language that supports compilation to LLVM IR, such as C, C++, Rust, or Swift. Direct manipulation of LLVM IR allows Mull to do less work to generate mutations: only modiﬁed fragments of IR code are recompiled, and this results in faster processing of mutated programs. To our knowledge, no existing mutation testing tool provides these capabilities for compiled programming languages. We describe the algorithm and implementation details of Mull, highlight current limitations of Mull, and present the results of our evaluation of Mull on real-world projects such as RODOS, OpenSSL, LLVM.},

It employs a combinational design in the storage layer to engage multiple storage engines constructed for diﬀerent storage models. PaxosStore is characteristic of extracting the Paxos-based distributed consensus protocol as a middleware that is universally accessible to the underlying multi-model storage engines. This facilitates tuning, maintaining, scaling and extending the storage engines. According to our experience in engineering practice, to achieve a practical consistent read/write protocol is far more complex than its theory. To tackle such engineering complexity, we propose a layered design of the Paxos-based storage protocol stack, where PaxosLog, the key data structure used in the protocol, is devised to bridge the programmingoriented consistent read/write to the storage-oriented Paxos procedure. Additionally, we present optimizations based on Paxos that made fault-tolerance more eﬃcient. Discussion throughout the paper primarily focuses on pragmatic solutions that could be insightful for building practical distributed storage systems.},

	abstract = {For a decade, the Ceph distributed file system followed the conventional wisdom of building its storage backend on top of local file systems. This is a preferred choice for most distributed file systems today because it allows them to benefit from the convenience and maturity of battle-tested code. Ceph’s experience, however, shows that this comes at a high price. First, developing a zero-overhead transaction mechanism is challenging. Second, metadata performance at the local level can significantly affect performance at the distributed level. Third, supporting emerging storage hardware is painstakingly slow. Ceph addressed these issues with BlueStore, a new backend designed to run directly on raw storage devices. In only two years since its inception, BlueStore outperformed previous established backends and is adopted by 70\% of users in production. By running in user space and fully controlling the I/O stack, it has enabled space-efficient metadata and data checksums, fast overwrites of erasure-coded data, inline compression, decreased performance variability, and avoided a series of performance pitfalls of local file systems. Finally, it makes the adoption of backwards-incompatible storage hardware possible, an important trait in a changing storage landscape that is learning to embrace hardware diversity.},

Usually, these cameras provide cues and evidence after crimes conducted, while they are rarely used to prevent or stop criminal activities in time. It is both time and labor consuming to manually monitor a large amount of video data from surveillance cameras. Therefore, automatically recognizing violent behaviors from video signals becomes essential. In this paper, we summarize several existing video datasets for violence detection and propose a new video dataset1 with more than 2,000 videos captured by surveillance cameras in real-world scenes. Also, we present a new method that utilizes both the merits of 3DCNNs and optical ﬂow, namely Flow Gated Network. The proposed approach obtains an accuracy of 86.75\% on the test set of our proposed RWF-2000 database.},

	abstract = {The strength of obfuscated software has increased over the recent years. Compiler based obfuscation has become the de facto standard in the industry and recent papers also show that injection of obfuscation techniques is done at the compiler level. In this paper we discuss a generic approach for deobfuscation and recompilation of obfuscated code based on the compiler framework LLVM. We show how binary code can be lifted back into the compiler intermediate language LLVM-IR and explain how we recover the control flow graph of an obfuscated binary function with an iterative control flow graph construction algorithm [3] based on compiler optimizations and satisfiability modulo theories (SMT) solving. Our approach does not make any assumptions about the obfuscated code, but instead uses strong compiler optimizations available in LLVM and Souper Optimizer to simplify away the obfuscation. Our experimental results show that this approach can be effective to weaken or even remove the applied obfuscation techniques like constant unfolding, certain arithmetic–based opaque expressions, dead code insertions, bogus control flow or integer encoding found in public and commercial obfuscators. The recovered LLVM-IR can be further processed by custom deobfuscation passes that are now applied at the same level as the injected obfuscation techniques or recompiled with one of the available LLVM backends. The presented work is implemented in a deobfuscation tool called SATURN (Figure 1).},

	abstract = {This text focuses on the use of smoothing methods for developing and estimating differential equations following recent developments in functional data analysis and building on techniques described in Ramsay and Silverman (2005) Functional Data Analysis. The central concept of a dynamical system as a buffer that translates sudden changes in input into smooth controlled output responses has led to applications of previously analyzed data, opening up entirely new opportunities for dynamical systems. The technical level has been kept low so that those with little or no exposure to differential equations as modeling objects can be brought into this data analysis landscape. There are already many texts on the mathematical properties of ordinary differential equations, or dynamic models, and there is a large literature distributed over many fields on models for real world processes consisting of differential equations. However, a researcher interested in fitting such a model to data, or a statistician interested in the properties of differential equations estimated from data will find rather less to work with. This book fills that gap. Offers an accessible text to those with little or no exposure to differential equations as modeling objects Updates and builds on techniques from the popular Functional Data Analysis (Ramsay and Silverman, 2005) Opens up new opportunities for dynamical systems and presents additional applications for previously analyzed data Jim Ramsay, PhD, is Professor Emeritus of Psychology and an Associate Member in the Department of Mathematics and Statistics at McGill University.

The derivative z(t) of the state z(t) is approximated by the analytic derivative of the corresponding interpolating polynomial. State and control inequality constraints are collocated at LegendMauss-Lohatto nodes. The integral involved in the definition of the performance index is discretized based on Gauss-Lobatto quadrature rule. The optimal control problem is thereby converted into a mathematical programming program. Thus existing, well-developed optimization algorithms may be used to solve the transformed problem. The method is easy to implement, capable of handling various types of constraints, and yields very accurate results. Illustrative examples are included to demonstrate the capability of the proposed method, and a comparison is made with existing metbods in the literature.},

Ochratoxins and Aflatoxins are mycotoxins of major significance and hence there has been significant research on broad range of analytical and detection techniques that could be useful and practical. Due to the variety of structures of these toxins, it is impossible to use one standard technique for analysis and/or detection. Practical requirements for high-sensitivity analysis and the need for a specialist laboratory setting create challenges for routine analysis. Several existing analytical techniques, which offer flexible and broad-based methods of analysis and in some cases detection, have been discussed in this manuscript. There are a number of methods used, of which many are lab-based, but to our knowledge there seems to be no single technique that stands out above the rest, although analytical liquid chromatography, commonly linked with mass spectroscopy is likely to be popular. This review manuscript discusses (a) sample pre-treatment methods such as liquid-liquid extraction (LLE), supercritical fluid extraction (SFE), solid phase extraction (SPE), (b) separation methods such as (TLC), high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC), gas chromatography (GC), and capillary electrophoresis (CE) and (c) others such as ELISA. Further currents trends, advantages and disadvantages and future prospects of these methods have been discussed.},

	abstract = {Achieving high performance for concurrent applications on modern multiprocessors remains challenging. Many programmers avoid locking to improve performance, while others replace locks with non-blocking synchronization to protect against deadlock, priority inversion, and convoying. In both cases, dynamic data structures that avoid locking require a memory reclamation scheme that reclaims elements once they are no longer in use. The performance of existing memory reclamation schemes has not been thoroughly evaluated. We conduct the first fair and comprehensive comparison of three recent schemes-quiescent-state-based reclamation, epoch-based reclamation, and hazard-pointer-based reclamation-using a flexible microbenchmark. Our results show that there is no globally optimal scheme. When evaluating lockless synchronization, programmers and algorithm designers should thus carefully consider the data structure, the workload, and the execution environment, each of which can dramatically affect the memory reclamation performance. We discuss the consequences of our results for programmers and algorithm designers. Finally, we describe the use of one scheme, quiescent-state-based reclamation, in the context of an OS kernel-an execution environment which is well suited to this scheme. ?? 2007 Elsevier Inc.

CP motor impairment and associated speech deficits often hinder cognitive assessment, with the result being that not all CP studies consider cognitive dysfunction. Raven's Coloured Progressive Matrices is a simple, rapid test which can be used in persons with severe motor impairment and speech limitations. We studied whether this test can offer a reliable measure of cognitive functioning in CP. METHOD: Visuoperceptual, language, memory and frontal lobe functions were evaluated in 30 participants with severe motor impaired CP and a variety of speech difficulties. The relationship between Raven's Coloured Progressive Matrices and a variety of tests was analysed. RESULTS: Raven's Coloured Progressive Matrices performance was associated with visuoperceptual, language, visual and verbal memory but not with frontal functions. Receptive vocabulary and visuospatial measures were the best predictors of Raven's Coloured Progressive Matrices raw scores. CONCLUSIONS: Raven's Coloured Progressive Matrices is a fast, easy-to-administer test able to obtain a measure related with linguistic, visuoperceptual, and memory cognitive functioning in persons with CP despite their motor and speech disorders.},

Our data show considerable gamma-intensity, so far unobserved in high-resolution gamma-ray spectroscopy, from states at high excitation energy. We also find significant differences with the beta intensity that can be deduced from existing measurements of the beta spectrum. We evaluate the impact of the present data on reactor decay heat using summation calculations. Although the effect is relatively small it helps to reduce the discrepancy between calculations and integral measurements of the photon component for 235U fission at cooling times in the range 1 to 100 s. We also use summation calculations to evaluate the impact of present data on reactor antineutrino spectra. We find a significant effect at antineutrino energies in the range of 5 to 9 MeV. In addition, we observe an unexpected strong probability for gamma emission from neutron unbound states populated in the daughter nucleus. The gamma branching is compared to Hauser-Feshbach calculations which allow one to explain the large value for bromine isotopes as due to nuclear structure. However the branching for 94Rb, although much smaller, hints of the need to increase the radiative width by one order-of-magnitude. This leads to a similar increase in the calculated (n,gamma) cross section for this very neutron-rich nucleus with a potential impact on r-process abundance calculations.},

We identify two important dynamical co-conspirators: 1) the points where the attractive force of the host halo and satellite are balanced do not occur at equal distances from the satellite centre or at the same equipotential value for massive satellites, breaking the morphological symmetry of the leading and trailing tails; and 2) the escaped ejecta in the leading (trailing) tail continues to be decelerated (accelerated) by the satellite's gravity leading to large offsets of the ejecta orbits from the satellite orbit. The effect of the satellite's self gravity decreases only weakly with a decreasing ratio of satellite mass to host halo mass, demonstrating the importance of these effects over a wide range of subhalo masses. Not only will the morphology of the leading and trailing tails for massive satellites be different, but the observed radial velocities of the tails will be displaced from that of the satellite orbit; both the displacement and the peak radial velocity is proportional to satellite mass. If the tails are assumed to follow the progenitor satellite orbits, the tails from satellites with masses greater than 0.0001 of the host halo virial mass in a spherical halo will appear to indicate a flattened halo. Therefore, a constraint on the Milky Way halo shape using tidal streams requires mass-dependent modelling. Similarly, we compute the the distribution of tail orbits both in E\_\{r\}-r{\textasciicircum}\{-2\} space and in E-L\_\{z\} space, advocated for identifying satellite stream relics. The acceleration of ejecta by a massive satellite during escape spreads the velocity distribution and obscures the signature of a well-defined ``moving group'' in phase space.},

	abstract = {Most models in machine learning contain at least one hyperparameter to control for model complexity. Choosing an appropriate set of hyperparameters is both crucial in terms of model accuracy and computationally challenging. In this work we propose an algorithm for the optimization of continuous hyperparameters using inexact gradient information. An advantage of this method is that hyperparameters can be updated before model parameters have fully converged. We also give sufficient conditions for the global convergence of this method, based on regularity conditions of the involved functions and summability of errors. Finally, we validate the empirical performance of this method on the estimation of regularization constants of L2-regularized logistic regression and kernel Ridge regression. Empirical benchmarks indicate that our approach is highly competitive with respect to state of the art methods.},

These results suggest that planning for the future is not uniquely human and evolved independently in distantly related species to address common problems ( 4 ). On page 202 of this issue, Kabadayi and Osvath ( 5 ) show that ravens anticipate the nature, time, and location of a future event based on previous experiences. The ravens' behavior is not merely prospective, anticipating future states ( 6 ); rather, they flexibly apply future planning in behaviors not typically seen in the wild.},

Symptoms can go from benign to large asset price bubbles and excess credit creation, which are among the best predictors of financial crises. A VAR analysis suggests that one of the determinants of the global financial cycle is monetary policy in the centre country, which affects leverage of global banks, capital flows and credit growth in the international financial system. Whenever capital is freely mobile, the global financial cycle constrains national monetary policies regardless of the exchange rate regime.},

One deﬁnition is typically deployed by scholars for the narrow analysis of non-bank ﬁnancial intermediation as a viable alternative to banking. The other, more recent, deﬁnition circulates in the policy world to capture a new agenda of engineering (securities) marketbased ﬁnance. This article argues that this second deﬁnition captures the essential but neglected aspect of shadow banking in DECs. The ‘shadow banking into market-based ﬁnance’ narrative reafﬁrms the celebratory tone of the ﬁnancial globalization cum liberalization thesis dominant before the global ﬁnancial crisis. It seeks to depoliticize contentious debates about capital ﬂows and the constraints that ﬁnancialized globalization poses to development, instead asking DECs to encourage portfolio ﬂows, relax the regulatory grip on shadow funding markets and tap into the growing global demand for securities that marks the new age of asset management. China illustrates this argument well. In joining the global push for market-based ﬁnance with the ambition to further its RMB internationalization agenda, China underestimates the (Minsky-type) fragilities involved.},

While OS-based encryp- tion is widely accepted in practical situations, hypervisor- based encryption offers significant advantages such as OS independence and providing more secure environments. Un- fortunately, the initial deployment cost of hypervisor-based encryption systems is rarely discussed. In this paper, we present a hypervisor-based encryption scheme that allows instant deployment of full disk encryption into existing sys- tems without disturbing user’s activities. To avoid waiting for encryption to be completed, hypervisors perform back- ground encryption that does not incur significant perfor- mance penalty on guest OSs by carefully watching guest OS activities and moderating the degree of encryption speed. Our scheme does not require conversion of disk images or modification of OS configurations to install hypervisors by exploiting BitVisor, a thin hypervisor for enforcing secu- rity, that can be easily injected to existing systems. Our experimental results on Windows 7 show that application benchmark scores are not significantly affected by the back- ground encryption and the overhead on sequential disk ac- cess throughput is at most 24\%. The throughput of our background encryption is comparable to that of existing OS- based background encryption systems.},

However, uninhibited coordination-free execution can compromise application correctness, or consistency. When is coordination necessary for correctness? The classic use of serializable transactions is sufﬁcient to maintain correctness but is not necessary for all applications, sacriﬁcing potential scalability. In this paper, we develop a formal framework, invariant conﬂuence, that determines whether an application requires coordination for correct execution. By operating on application-level invariants over database states (e.g., integrity constraints), invariant conﬂuence analysis provides a necessary and sufﬁcient condition for safe, coordination-free execution. When programmers specify their application invariants, this analysis allows databases to coordinate only when anomalies that might violate invariants are possible. We analyze the invariant conﬂuence of common invariants and operations from real-world database systems (i.e., integrity constraints) and applications and show that many are invariant conﬂuent and therefore achievable without coordination. We apply these results to a proof-of-concept coordination-avoiding database prototype and demonstrate sizable performance gains compared to serializable execution, notably a 25-fold improvement over prior TPC-C New-Order performance on a 200 server cluster.},

It has a number of important properties, including solid mathematical foundations, good time and space performance, small code size, multiple random streams, and better cryptographic properties than are typical for a general-purpose generator. The key idea is to pass the output of a fast well-understood “medium quality” random number generator to an eﬃcient permutation function (a.k.a. hash function), built from composable primitives, that enhances the quality of the output. The algorithm can be applied at variety of bit sizes, including and bits (which provide - and -bit outputs, with periods of 264 and 2128). Optionally, we can provide each b-bit generator with a b−1 bit stream-selection constant, thereby providing 2b−1 random streams, which are full period and entirely distinct. An extension adds up to 2b -dimensional equidistribution for a total period of 2b2b . The construction of the permutation function and the periodextension technique are both founded on the idea of permutation functions on tuples. In its standard variants, b-bit generators use a 2b/2-to- function to produce b/2 bits of output. These functions can be designed to make it diﬃcult for an adversary to discover the generator’s internal state by examining its output, and thus make it challenging to predict. This property, coupled with the ability to easily switch between random streams, provides many of the beneﬁts provided by cryptographically secure generators without the overheads usually associated with those generators.},

	abstract = {This paper introduces the first state-based formalization of isolation guarantees. Our approach is premised on a simple observation: applications view storage systems as black-boxes that transition through a series of states, a subset of which are observed by applications. Defining isolation guarantees in terms of these states frees definitions from implementation-specific assumptions. It makes immediately clear what anomalies, if any, applications can expect to observe, thus bridging the gap that exists today between how isolation guarantees are defined and how they are perceived. The clarity that results from definitions based on client-observable states brings forth several benefits. First, it allows us to easily compare the guarantees of distinct, but semantically close, isolation guarantees. We find that several well-known guarantees, previously thought to be distinct, are in fact equivalent, and that many previously incomparable flavors of snapshot isolation can be organized in a clean hierarchy. Second, freeing definitions from implementation-specific artefacts can suggest more efficient implementations of the same isolation guarantee. We show how a client-centric implementation of parallel snapshot isolation can be more resilient to slowdown cascades, a common phenomenon in large-scale datacenters.},

Using administrative data with precise information on mortality and retirement, we find that the policy change induced eligible workers to exit the labor force significantly earlier.

	url = {https://github.com/jamiefarnes/negative-mass-simulator},
	abstract = {Dark energy and dark matter constitute 95\% of the observable Universe. Yet the physical nature of these two phenomena remains a mystery. Einstein suggested a long-forgotten solution: gravitationally repulsive negative masses, which drive cosmic expansion and cannot coalesce into light-emitting structures. However, contemporary cosmological results are derived upon the reasonable assumption that the Universe only contains positive masses. By reconsidering this assumption, I have constructed a toy model which suggests that both dark phenomena can be unified into a single negative mass fluid. The model is a modified ΛCDM cosmology, and indicates that continuously-created negative masses can resemble the cosmological constant and can flatten the rotation curves of galaxies. The model leads to a cyclic universe with a time-variable Hubble parameter, potentially providing compatibility with the current tension that is emerging in cosmological measurements. In the first three-dimensional N-body simulations of negative mass matter in the scientific literature, this exotic material naturally forms haloes around galaxies that extend to several galactic radii. These haloes are not cuspy. The proposed cosmological model is therefore able to predict the observed distribution of dark matter in galaxies from first principles. The model makes several testable predictions and seems to have the potential to be consistent with observational evidence from distant supernovae, the cosmic microwave background, and galaxy clusters. These findings may imply that negative masses are a real and physical aspect of our Universe, or alternatively may imply the existence of a superseding theory that in some limit can be modelled by effective negative masses. Both cases lead to the surprising conclusion that the compelling puzzle of the dark Universe may have been due to a simple sign error.},

In this paper, we study and evaluate the effect of the GDPR on the online advertising ecosystem. In a first step, we measure the impact of the legislation on the connections (regarding cookie syncing) between third-parties and show that the general structure how the entities are arranged is not affected by the GDPR. However, we find that the new regulation has a statistically significant impact on the number of connections, which shrinks by around 40\%. Furthermore, we analyze the right to data portability by evaluating the subject access right process of popular companies in this ecosystem and observe differences between the processes implemented by the companies and how they interpret the new legislation. We exercised our right of access under GDPR with 36 companies that had tracked us online. Although 32 companies (89\%) we inquired replied within the period defined by law, only 21 (58\%) finished the process by the deadline set in the GDPR.

Data on the US distributions of income and wealth are used to construct several Material Power Indices, which suggest that the wealthiest Americans may exert vastly greater political influence than average citizens and that a very small group of the wealthiest (perhaps the top tenth of 1 percent) may have sufficient power to dominate policy in certain key areas.

	abstract = {We use the Smaller Alignment Index (SALI) to distinguish rapidly and with certainty between ordered and chaotic motion in Hamiltonian flows. This distinction is based on the different behavior of the SALI for the two cases: the index fluctuates around non--zero values for ordered orbits, while it tends rapidly to zero for chaotic orbits. We present a detailed study of SALI's behavior for chaotic orbits and show that in this case the SALI exponentially converges to zero, following a time rate depending on the difference of the two largest Lyapunov exponents \${\textbackslash}sigma\_1\$, \${\textbackslash}sigma\_2\$ i.e. \$SALI {\textbackslash}propto e{\textasciicircum}\{-({\textbackslash}sigma\_1-{\textbackslash}sigma\_2)t\}\$. Exploiting the advantages of the SALI method, we demonstrate how one can rapidly identify even tiny regions of order or chaos in the phase space of Hamiltonian systems of 2 and 3 degrees of freedom.},

	abstract = {One of the most important challenges in distributed computing is ensuring that services are correct and available despite faults. Recently it has been argued that fault detection can be factored out from computation, and that a generic fault detection service can be a useful abstraction for building distributed systems. However, while fault detection has been extensively studied for crash faults, little is known about detecting more general kinds of faults. This paper explores the power and the inherent costs of generic fault detection in a distributed system. We propose a formal framework that allows us to partition the set of all faults that can possibly occur in a distributed computation into several fault classes. Then we formulate the fault detection problem for a given fault class, and we show that this problemcan be solved for only two specific fault classes, namely omission faults and commission faults. Finally, we derive tight lower bounds on the cost of solving the problem for these two classes in asynchronousmessage-passing systems.},

If the neutrino mixing angle (so far unknown) is not very small, then the neutrino oscillation length is of the size of the Earth, and we can use the phenomenon of neutrino matter oscillations to study the Earth's density distribution. Although neutrino attenuation data have already been proposed as a means to infer the density structure of the Earth, we show that neutrino oscillation data could also be used to make a density tomograph of the Earth. A numerical experiment in which neutrino beams from an accelerator are sent across the Earth, and are detected at six different locations on the Earth's surface, shows the feasibility of using neutrino oscillation data, with the advantage of using only currently available neutrino energies.},

	abstract = {We examine the statistics of the low-redshift Ly-alpha forest in an adaptive mesh refinement hydrodynamic cosmological simulation of sufficient volume to include distinct large-scale environments. We compare our HI column density distribution of absorbers both with recent work and between two highly-refined regions of our simulation: a large-scale overdensity and a large-scale underdensity (on scales of approximately 20 Mpc). We recover the average results presented in Kollmeier et al. (2014) using different simulation methods. We further break down these results as a function of environment to examine the detailed dependence of absorber statistics on large-scale density. We find that the slope of the HI column density distribution in the 10\${\textasciicircum}\{12.5\}\$ \${\textbackslash}le\$ N\$\_\{HI\}\$/cm\${\textasciicircum}\{-2\}\$ \${\textbackslash}le\$ 10\${\textasciicircum}\{14.5\}\$ range depends on environment such that the slope becomes steeper for higher environmental density, and this difference reflects distinct physical conditions of the intergalactic medium on these scales. We track this difference to the different temperature structures of filaments in varying environments. Specifically, filaments in the overdensity are hotter and, correspondingly, are composed of gas with lower HI fractions than those in underdense environments. Our results highlight that in order to understand the physics driving the HI CDD, we need not only improved accounting of the sources of ionizing UV photons, but also of the physical conditions of the IGM and how this may vary as a function of large-scale environment.},

We carry out N-body simulations of the Sagittarius stream to show that this giant stellar over-density is a confirmation of theoretical model predictions for the leading tail of the Sagittarius stream to cross the Milky Way plane in the Solar neighborhood. Radial velocity measurements are needed to confirm this association and to further constrain the shape of the Milky Way dark matter halo through a new generation of theoretical models. If the identification of Virgo over-density and the Sagittarius leading arm is correct, we predict highly negative radial velocities for the stars of Virgo over-density. The detection of this new portion of the Sagittarius tidal stream would represent an excellent target for the on-going and future kinematic surveys and for dark matter direct detection experiments in the proximity of the Sun.},

The velocity confirms the suggestion by Fosbury and Hawarden (1977) that this companion galaxy was the interloper responsible for the ring structure. The mass inferred from the dispersion is only 5-10\% of the mass of the Cartwheel itself as determined from the kinematics of the ring. It is pointed out that this low mass is not sufficient to account for the observed ring by the collisionless kinematic model of Lynds and Toomre (1976). It is thought likely, however, that whereas the underlying mechanism is an encounter of the kind suggested by Lynds and Toomre, the ring is brightened by the star formation induced.},

A view of IS alignment is presented about organizations that draws and builds on complexity theory and especially its focus on coevolution-based self-organized emergent behaviour and structure, which provides important insights for dealing with the emergent nature of IS alignment. This view considers Business/IS alignment as a series of adjustments at three levels of analysis: individual, operational, and strategic, and suggests several enabling conditions – principles of adaptation and scale-free dynamics – aimed at speeding up the adaptive coevolutionary dynamics among the three levels.},

Analysis of the material has shown that much of the halo is made up of cannibalized satellite galaxies, and that dark matter is distributed nearly spherically in the Milky Way. It remains unclear, however, whether cannibalized substructures are as common in the haloes of galaxies as predicted by galaxy-formation theory. Here we report the discovery of a giant stream of metal-rich stars within the halo of the nearest large galaxy, M31 (the Andromeda galaxy). The source of this stream could be the dwarf galaxies M32 and NGC205, which are close companions of M31 and which may have lost a substantial number of stars owing to tidal interactions. The results demonstrate that the epoch of galaxy building still continues, albeit at a modest rate, and that tidal streams may be a generic feature of galaxy haloes.},

Most of these stars are within 126 of the celestial equator. We present color-magnitude diagrams (CMDs) for stars in two previously discovered, tidally disrupted structures. The CMDs and turnoff colors are consistent with those of the Sagittarius dwarf galaxy, as had been predicted. In one direction, we are even able to detect a clump of red stars, similar to that of the Sagittarius dwarf, from stars spread across 110 deg2 of sky. Focusing on stars with the colors of F turnoff objects, we identify at least five additional overdensities of stars. Four of these may be pieces of the same halo structure, which would cover a region of the sky at least 40° in diameter, at a distance of 11 kpc from the Sun (18 kpc from the center of the Galaxy). The turnoff is significantly bluer than that of thick-disk stars, yet the stars lie closer to the Galactic plane than a power-law spheroid predicts. We suggest two models to explain this new structure. One possibility is that this new structure could be a new dwarf satellite of the Milky Way, hidden in the Galactic plane and in the process of being tidally disrupted. The other possibility is that it could be part of a disklike distribution of stars which is metal-poor, with a scale height of approximately 2 kpc and a scale length of approximately 10 kpc. The fifth overdensity, which is 20 kpc away, is some distance from the Sagittarius dwarf streamer orbit and is not associated with any known Galactic structure. We have tentatively identified a sixth overdensity in the halo. If this sixth structure is instead part of a smooth distribution of halo stars (the spheroid), then the spheroid must be very flattened, with axial ratio q = 0.5. It is likely that there are many smaller streams of stars in the Galactic halo.},

	abstract = {Parallelism is the key to achieving high performance in computing. However, writing efficient and scalable parallel programs is notoriously difficult, and often requires significant expertise. To address this challenge, it is crucial to provide programmers with high-level tools to enable them to develop solutions efficiently, and at the same time emphasize the theoretical and practical aspects of algorithm design to allow the solutions developed to run efficiently under all possible settings. This thesis addresses this challenge using a three-pronged approach consisting of the design of shared-memory programming techniques, frameworks, and algorithms for important problems in computing. The thesis provides evidence that with appropriate programming techniques, frameworks, and algorithms, shared-memory programs can be simple, fast, and scalable, both in theory and in practice. The results developed in this thesis serve to ease the transition into the multicore era. The first part of this thesis introduces tools and techniques for deterministic parallel programming, including means for encapsulating nondeterminism via powerful commutative building blocks, as well as a novel framework for executing sequential iterative loops in parallel, which lead to deterministic parallel algorithms that are efficient both in theory and in practice. The second part of this thesis introduces Ligra, the first high-level sharedmemory framework for parallel graph traversal algorithms. The framework allows programmers to express graph traversal algorithms using very short and concise code, delivers performance competitive with that of highly-optimized code, and is up to orders of magnitude faster than existing systems designed for distributed memory. This part of the thesis also introduces Ligra+, which extends Ligra with graph compression techniques to reduce space usage and improve parallel performance at the same time, and is also the first graph processing system to support in-memory graph compression. The third and fourth parts of this thesis bridge the gap between theory and practice in parallel algorithm design by introducing the first algorithms for a variety of important problems on graphs and strings that are efficient both in theory and in practice. For example, the thesis develops the first linear-work and polylogarithmic-depth algorithms for suffix tree construction and graph connectivity that are also practical, as well as a work-efficient, polylogarithmicdepth, and cache-efficient shared-memory algorithm for triangle computations that achieves a 2–5x speedup over the best existing algorithms on 40 cores.},

	abstract = {This textbook is for the standard, one-semester, junior-senior course that often goes by the title "Elementary Partial Differential Equations" or "Boundary Value Problems". The audience consists of students in mathematics, engineering, and the sciences. The topics include derivations of some of the standard models of mathematical physics and methods for solving those equations on unbounded and bounded domains, and applications of PDE's to biology. The text differs from other texts in its brevity; yet it provides coverage of the main topics usually studied in the standard course, as well as an introduction to using computer algebra packages to solve and understand partial differential equations. For the 3rd edition the section on numerical methods has been considerably expanded to reflect their central role in PDE's. A treatment of the finite element method has been included and the code for numerical calculations is now written for MATLAB. Nonetheless the brevity of the text has been maintained. To further aid the reader in mastering the material and using the book, the clarity of the exercises has been improved, more routine exercises have been included, and the entire text has been visually reformatted to improve readability.},

	abstract = {Undergraduate students often struggle to learn mathematics because introductory classes are taught in large lectures that do not engage students in active problem-solving. These students do not connect mathematics to their lives and feel that learning mathematics is a solitary undertaking. We now use Tablet PCs in a networked classroom to address these challenges. Students in classes that use the Tablet PCs can view and annotate the instructor's Powerpoint slides in real time and also participate in interactive problem-solving. Students save their own annotated slides for subsequent review. They also have immediate access to the synchronized screen capture and audio recording of the class since the instructor posts this file to the course management website. These technological interventions allow students to focus on classroom activities rather than on note-taking. To date, students have taken three introductory undergraduate mathematics courses (College Algebra and Trigonometry, Calculus I, and Calculus II) using Tablet PCs. Student attendance and retention were better in the cohort of students who participated in the Tablet PC courses than in comparable non-Tablet PC courses taught by the same instructor. The evaluation of the instructor was unchanged.},

	abstract = {The unusual morphology of the Andromeda galaxy (Messier 31, the closest spiral galaxy to the Milky Way) has long been an enigma. Although regarded for decades as showing little evidence of a violent history, M31 has a well-known outer ring of star formation at a radius of ten kiloparsecs whose centre is offset from the galaxy nucleus. In addition, the outer galaxy disk is warped, as seen at both optical and radio wavelengths. The halo contains numerous loops and ripples. Here we report the presence of a second, inner dust ring with projected dimensions of 1.5 x 1 kiloparsecs and offset by about half a kiloparsec from the centre of the galaxy (based upon an analysis of previously-obtained data). The two rings appear to be density waves propagating in the disk. Numerical simulations indicate that both rings result from a companion galaxy plunging through the centre of the disk of M31. The most likely interloper is M32. Head-on collisions between galaxies are rare, but it appears nonetheless that one took place 210 million years ago in our Local Group of galaxies.},

Students (N = 85) experiencing academic difficulty were recruited to participate in a randomized, controlled intervention. Participants were randomly assigned to 1 of 2 intervention groups: Half completed the goal-setting program, and half completed a control task with intervention-quality face validity. After a 4-month period, students who completed the goal-setting intervention displayed significant improvements in academic performance compared with the control group.

	abstract = {In the Federal Communications Commission, Ronald Coase exposed deep foundations via normative argument buttressed by astute historical observation. The government controlled scarce frequencies, issuing sharply limited use rights.  Spillovers were said to be otherwise endemic.  Coase saw that Government limited conflicts by restricting uses; property owners perform an analogous function via the “price system.” The government solution was inefficient unless the net benefits of the alternative property regime were lower. Coase augured that the price system would outperform. His spectrum auction proposal was mocked by communications policy experts, opposed by industry interests, and ridiculed by policy makers. Hence, it took until July 25, 1994 for FCC license sales to commence. Today, some 73 U.S. auctions have been held, 27,484 licenses sold, and \$52.6 billion paid. The reform is a textbook example of economic policy success.   Herein, we examine Coase’s seminal 1959 paper on two levels. First, we note its analytical symmetry, comparing administrative to market mechanisms under the assumption of positive transaction costs. This fundamental insight had its beginning in Coase’s acclaimed article on the firm, and continued with his subsequent treatment of social cost. Second, we investigate why spectrum policies have stopped well short of the property rights regime that Coase advocated, considering rent-seeking dynamics and the emergence of new theories challenging Coase’s property framework. One conclusion is easily rendered: competitive bidding is now the default tool in wireless license awards. By rule of thumb, about \$17 billion in U.S. welfare losses have been averted.

Greater focus has recently been placed on underprepared students who enter public schools only to be passed from grade to grade, often condemned to join the one third of their classmates who drop out before receiving a high-school diploma. A nation’s standard of living depends heavily upon the ability of its citizens to compete for quality jobs. A survey on the current status of research on giftedness and gifted education suggests that abilities can be enhanced through development, different talents develop at different rates and must be addressed accordingly, and that young people need psychological strength training to help them succeed. Ability is developed by motivation and the combination of motivation and ability, and the pursuit of targeted opportunities is unbeatable.

We analyzed records of 599,255 deaths from 1979 through 2016 from the National Vital Statistics System in which accidental drug poisoning was identified as the main cause of death. By examining all available data on accidental poisoning deaths back to 1979 and showing that the overall 38-year curve is exponential, we provide evidence that the current wave of opioid overdose deaths (due to prescription opioids, heroin, and fentanyl) may just be the latest manifestation of a more fundamental longer-term process. The 38+ year smooth exponential curve of total U.S. annual accidental drug poisoning deaths is a composite of multiple distinctive subepidemics of different drugs (primarily prescription opioids, heroin, methadone, synthetic opioids, cocaine, and methamphetamine), each with its own specific demographic and geographic characteristics.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

Maelstrom provides a traffic management framework with modular, reusable primitives that can be composed to safely and efficiently drain the traffic of interdependent services from one or more failing datacenters to the healthy ones. Maelstrom ensures safety by encoding inter-service dependencies and resource constraints. Maelstrom uses health monitoring to implement feedback control so that all specified constraints are satisfied by the traffic drains and recovery procedures executed during disaster mitiga-tion. Maelstrom exploits parallelism to drain and restore independent traffic sources efficiently. We verify the correctness of Maelstrom's disaster mit-igation and recovery procedures by running large-scale tests that drain production traffic from entire datacenters and then retore the traffic back to the datacenters. These tests (termed drain tests) help us gain a deep understanding of our complex systems, and provide a venue for continually improving the reliability of our infrastructure. Maelstrom has been in production at Facebook for more than four years, and has been successfully used to mitigate and recover from 100+ datacenter outages.},

	abstract = {Context. J1407 (1SWASP J140747.93-394542.6 in full) is a young star in the Scorpius-Centaurus OB association that underwent a series of complex eclipses over 56 days in 2007. To explain these, it was hypothesised that a secondary substellar companion, J1407b, has a giant ring system filling a large fraction of the Hill sphere, causing the eclipses. Observations have not successfully detected J1407b, but do rule out circular orbits for the companion around the primary star. Aims. We test to what degree the ring model of J1407b could survive in an eccentric orbit required to fit the observations. Methods. We run N-body simulations under the AMUSE framework to test the stability of Hill radius-filling systems where the companion is on an eccentric orbit. Results. We strongly rule out prograde ring systems and find that a secondary of 60 to 100MJup with an 11 year orbital period and retrograde orbiting material can survive for at least \$10{\textasciicircum}4\$ orbits and produce eclipses with similar durations as the observed one.},

	abstract = {Landauer's principle, often regarded as the basic principle of the thermodynamics of information processing, holds that any logically irreversible manipulation of information, such as the erasure of a bit or the merging of two computation paths, must be accompanied by a corresponding entropy increase in non-information-bearing degrees of freedom of the information-processing apparatus or its environment. Conversely, it is generally accepted that any logically reversible transformation of information can in principle be accomplished by an appropriate physical mechanism operating in a thermodynamically reversible fashion. These notions have sometimes been criticized either as being false, or as being trivial and obvious, and therefore unhelpful for purposes such as explaining why Maxwell's Demon cannot violate the second law of thermodynamics. Here I attempt to refute some of the arguments against Landauer's principle, while arguing that although in a sense it is indeed a straightforward consequence or restatement of the Second Law, it still has considerable pedagogic and explanatory power, especially in the context of other influential ideas in nineteenth and twentieth century physics. Similar arguments have been given by Jeffrey Bub (2002). © 2003 Published by Elsevier Science Ltd.},

It contains ideas that have been gained through experience; skilled authors will find themselves familiar with these ideas. The document is formated and structured like a typical journal publication. Each section describes what you should discuss in it. The abstract is what a person always reads first in a technical paper. Based on the content of the abstract, the reader will decide whether the pa- per is worthy enough to merit further study. The abstract should classify your research and contri- bution in the research areas. It should contain the following four parts: a brief introduction de- scribing the discipline that the paper belongs to; a clear and concise statement of your problem; a brief explanation of your solution and its key ideas; a brief description of the results obtained and their impacts. Lastly, provide a short list of index keyword terms.},

	abstract = {Commercial DBMSs, such as Microsoft SQL Server, cater to diverse workloads including transaction processing, decision support, and operational analytics. They also support variety in physical design structures such as B+ tree and columnstore. The benefits of B+ tree for OLTP workloads and columnstore for decision support workloads are well-understood. However, the importance of hybrid physical designs, consisting of both columnstore and B+ tree indexes on the same database, is not well-studied-a focus of this paper. We first quantify the trade-offs using carefully-crafted micro-benchmarks. This micro-benchmarking indicates that hybrid physical designs can result in orders of magnitude better performance depending on the workload. For complex real-world applications , choosing an appropriate combination of columnstore and B+ tree indexes for a database workload is challenging. We extend the Database Engine Tuning Advisor for Microsoft SQL Server to recommend a suitable combination of B+ tree and columnstore indexes for a given workload. Through extensive experiments using industry-standard benchmarks and several real-world customer workloads, we quantify how a physical design tool capable of recommending hybrid physical designs can result in orders of magnitude better execution costs compared to approaches that rely either on columnstore-only or B+ tree-only designs.

Light-by-light scattering (γγ → γγ) is a quantum-mechanical process that is forbidden in the classical theory of electrodynamics. This reaction is accessible at the Large Hadron Collider thanks to the large electromagnetic field strengths generated by ultra-relativistic colliding lead ions. Using 480 μ 1  of lead-lead collision data recorded at a centre-of-mass energy per nucleon pair of 5.02 TeV by the ATLAS detector, here we report evidence for light-by-light scattering. A total of 13 candidate events were observed with an expected background of 2.6 ± 0.7 events. After background subtraction and analysis corrections, the fiducial cross-section of the process Pb + Pb (γγ) → Pb (∗)  + Pb (∗) γγ ,for photon transverse energy E T   {\textgreater}  3GeV, photon absolute pseudorapidity {\textbar}η{\textbar}  {\textless} 2.4, diphoton invariant mass greater than 6GeV, diphoton transverse momentum lower than 2GeV and diphoton acoplanarity below 0.01, is measured to be 70 ± 24 (stat.) ±17 (syst.) nb, which is in agreement with the standard model predictions.},

	abstract = {RATIONALE: For unambiguous identification of Chemical Weapons Convention{\textbackslash}n(CWC)-related chemicals in environmental samples, the availability of{\textbackslash}nmass spectra, interpretation skills and rapid microsynthesis of{\textbackslash}nsuspected chemicals are essential requirements. For the first time, the{\textbackslash}nelectron ionization single quadrupole and electrospray ionization tandem{\textbackslash}nmass spectra of a series of O-alkyl N-\{[\}bis(dimethylamino){\textbackslash}nmethylidene]-P-methylphosphonamidates (Scheme 1, cpd 4) were studied for{\textbackslash}nCWC verification purposes.{\textbackslash}nMETHODS: O-Alkyl N-\{[\}bis(dimethylamino){\textbackslash}nmethylidene]-P-methylphosphonamidates were prepared through a{\textbackslash}nmicrosynthetic method and were analyzed using electron ionization and{\textbackslash}nelectrospray ionization mass spectrometry with gas and liquid{\textbackslash}nchromatography, respectively, as MS-inlet systems. General EI and ESI{\textbackslash}nfragmentation pathways were proposed and discussed, and{\textbackslash}ncollision-induced dissociation studies of the protonated derivatives of{\textbackslash}nthese compounds were performed to confirm proposed fragment ion{\textbackslash}nstructures by analyzing mass spectra of deuterated analogs.{\textbackslash}nRESULTS: Mass spectrometric studies revealed some interesting{\textbackslash}nfragmentation pathways during the ionization process, such as McLafferty{\textbackslash}nrearrangement, hydrogen rearrangement and a previously unknown{\textbackslash}nintramolecular electrophilic aromatic substitution reaction.{\textbackslash}nCONCLUSIONS: The EI and ESI fragmentation routes of the synthesized{\textbackslash}ncompounds 4 were investigated with the aim of detecting and identifying{\textbackslash}nCWC-related chemicals during on-site inspection and/or off-site analysis{\textbackslash}nand toxic chemical destruction monitoring.

The necessary software for computerizing this test was developed and programmed for use with an Apple II Plus microcomputer. Scores obtained from the computerized and traditional versions of the Raven's test were compared on total mean score, correlation with the WISC-R, Raven's subscale intercorrelations, and Raven's total mean score composition. In general, results indicate that the two versions of the Raven's Matrices do not statistically significantly differ on the dimensions tested in the present study. The relatively small number of subjects and the lack of rigorous experimental control limit generalization of the results. Continued research into the use of computerized psychological assessment is warranted.},

We examine how best minimum-redundancy coding can be implemented, with particular emphasis on the situation when n is large, perhaps of the order of 10$^{\textrm{6}}$. We review techniques for devising minimum-redundancy codes, and consider in detail how encoding and decoding should be accomplished. In particular, we describe a modified decoding method that allows improved decoding throughput, requiring just a few machine operations per output symbol (rather than for each decoded bit), and uses just a few hundred bytes of memory above and beyond the space required to store an enumeration of the source alphabet. We review methods for calculating codeword lengths, show how those codeword lengths should be used to derive a minimum-redundancy code that has the alphabetic sequence property, and describes a memory-compact method for decoding such canonical codes. An improved method for decoding canonical codes is also presented},

Piranha also integrates further on-chip functionality to allow for scalable multiprocessor configurations to be built in a glueless and modular fashion. The use of simple processor cores combined with an industry-standard ASIC design methodology allow us to complete our prototype within a short time-frame, with a team size and investment that are an order of magnitude smaller than that of a commercial microprocessor. Our detailed simulation results show that while each Piranha processor core is substantially slower than an aggressive next-generation processor, the integration of eight cores onto a single chip allows Piranha to outperform next-generation processors by up to 2.9 times (on a per chip basis) on important workloads such as OLTP. This performance advantage can approach a factor of five by using full-custom instead of ASIC logic. In addition to exploiting chip multiprocessing, the Piranha prototype incorporates several other unique design choices including a shared second-level cache with no inclusion, a highly optimized cache coherence protocol, and a novel I/O architecture.},

Are TIs that esoteric, or does this reflect a fundamental problem with the current piecemeal approach to finding them? To address this, we propose a new and complete electronic band theory that highlights the link between topology and local chemical bonding, and combines this with the conventional band theory of electrons. Topological Quantum Chemistry is a description of the universal global properties of all possible band structures and materials, comprised of a graph theoretical description of momentum space and a dual group theoretical description in real space. We classify the possible band structures for all 230 crystal symmetry groups that arise from local atomic orbitals, and show which are topologically nontrivial. We show how our topological band theory sheds new light on known TIs, and demonstrate the power of our method to predict a plethora of new TIs.},

Nuclear weapons can influence state decisions about a range of strategic choices relating to military aggression, the scope of foreign policy objectives, and relations with allies. The article offers a theory to explain why emerging nuclear powers use nuclear weapons to facilitate different foreign policies: becoming more or less aggressive; providing additional support to allies or proxies, seeking independence from allies; or expanding the state’s goals in international politics. I argue that a state’s choices depend on the presence of severe territorial threats or an ongoing war, the presence of allies that provide for the state’s security, and whether the state is increasing in relative power. The conclusion discusses implications of the argument for our understanding of nuclear weapons and the history of proliferation, and nonproliferation policy today.},

This paper is the first known compilation of past work in automatic sarcasm detection. We observe three milestones in the research so far: semi-supervised pattern extraction to identify implicit sentiment, use of hashtag-based supervision, and use of context beyond target text. In this paper, we describe datasets, approaches, trends and issues in sarcasm detection. We also discuss representative performance values, shared tasks and pointers to future work, as given in prior works.

Structural and functional neuroimaging studies have further shown that the hippocampus plays an important role in the performance on Raven's Progressive Matrices (RPM), a measure of reasoning ability and general fluid intelligence. Thus far, however, no study has examined the relationships between the SEMA5A gene polymorphism, hippocampal volume, and RPM performance. The current study collected both structural MRI, genetic, and behavioral data in 329 healthy Chinese adults, and examined associations between SEMA5A variants, hippocampal volume, and performance on RAPM (the advanced form of RPM). After controlling for intracranial volume (ICV), sex, and age, SEMA5A genetic polymorphism at the SNP rs42352 had the strongest association with hippocampal volume ( p= 0.00000552 and 0.000103 for right and left hippocampal volumes, respectively), with TT homozygotes having higher hippocampal volume than the other genotypes. Furthermore, there was a high correlation between right hippocampal volume and RAPM performance ( r= 0.42, p= 0.0000509) for SEMA5A rs42352 TT homozygotes. This study provides the first evidence for the involvement of the SEMA5A gene in hippocampal structure and their interaction on RAPM performance.

Despite the growing popularity of e-learning, we are not aware of any existing study comparing on-line vs. traditional classroom-based methods for teaching scientific writing.METHODS:Forty eight participants from a medical, nursing and physiotherapy background from US and Brazil were randomly assigned to two groups (n = 24 per group): An on-line writing workshop group (on-line group), in which participants used virtual communication, google docs and standard writing templates, and a standard writing guidance training (standard group) where participants received standard instruction without the aid of virtual communication and writing templates. Two outcomes, manuscript quality was assessed using the scores obtained in Six subgroup analysis scale as the primary outcome measure, and satisfaction scores with Likert scale were evaluated. To control for observer variability, inter-observer reliability was assessed using Fleiss\&apos;s kappa. A post-hoc analysis comparing rates of communication between mentors and participants was performed. Nonparametric tests were used to assess intervention efficacy.RESULTS:Excellent inter-observer reliability among three reviewers was found, with an Intraclass Correlation Coefficient (ICC) agreement = 0.931882 and ICC consistency = 0.932485. On-line group had better overall manuscript quality (p = 0.0017, SSQSavg score 75.3 +/- 14.21, ranging from 37 to 94) compared to the standard group (47.27 +/- 14.64, ranging from 20 to 72). Participant satisfaction was higher in the on-line group (4.3 +/- 0.73) compared to the standard group (3.09 +/- 1.11) (p = 0.001). The standard group also had fewer communication events compared to the on-line group (0.91 +/- 0.81 vs. 2.05 +/- 1.23; p = 0.0219).CONCLUSION:Our protocol for on-line scientific writing instruction is better than standard face-to-face instruction in terms of writing quality and student satisfaction. Future studies should evaluate the protocol efficacy in larger longitudinal cohorts involving participants from different languages.},

The justification for this attit ude is that it allows C compilers to optimize better. But while these “opti mizations” provide a factor 1.017 speedup with Clang-3.1 on SPECint 200 6, for non-benchmarks it also has a cost: if we go by the wishes of the compiler maintainers, we have to “fix” our working, conforming C progr ams; this requires a substantial effort, and can result in bigger and sl ower code. The effort could otherwise be invested in source-level optim izations by programmers, which can have a much bigger effect (e.g., a factor {\textgreater} 2 . 7 for Jon Bentley’s traveling salesman program).

We then combine these fingerprints with incremental sequence numbers, to create a tracking algorithm that does not rely on unique identi-fiers such as MAC addresses. Based on real-world datasets, we demonstrate that our algorithm can correctly track as much as 50\% of devices for at least 20 minutes. We also show that commodity Wi-Fi devices use predictable scram-bler seeds. These can be used to improve the performance of our tracking algorithm. Finally, we present two attacks that reveal the real MAC address of a device, even if MAC ad-dress randomization is used. In the first one, we create fake hotspots to induce clients to connect using their real MAC address. The second technique relies on the new 802.11u standard, commonly referred to as Hotspot 2.0, where we show that Linux and Windows send Access Network Query Protocol (ANQP) requests using their real MAC address.},

The fundamental insight behind these breakthroughs is as much statis-tical as computational. Machine intelligence became possible once researchers stopped approaching intelligence tasks procedurally and began tackling them empirically. Face recognition algorithms, for example, do not consist of hard-wired rules to scan for certain pixel combinations, based on human understanding of what constitutes a face. Instead, these algorithms use a large dataset of photos labeled as having a face or not to estimate a function f (x) that predicts the pres-ence y of a face from pixels x. This similarity to econometrics raises questions: Are these algorithms merely applying standard techniques to novel and large datasets? If there are fundamentally new empirical tools, how do they fit with what we know? As empirical economists, how can we use them? 1 We present a way of thinking about machine learning that gives it its own place in the econometric toolbox.

	doi = {10.1109/SP.2017.29},
	abstract = {As the most successful cryptocurrency to date, Bitcoin constitutes a target of choice for attackers. While many attack vectors have already been uncovered, one important vector has been left out though: attacking the currency via the Internet routing infrastructure itself. Indeed, by manipulating routing advertisements (BGP hijacks) or by naturally intercepting traffic, Autonomous Systems (ASes) can intercept and manipulate a large fraction of Bitcoin traffic. This paper presents the first taxonomy of routing attacks and their impact on Bitcoin, considering both small-scale attacks, targeting individual nodes, and large-scale attacks, targeting the network as a whole. While challenging, we show that two key properties make routing attacks practical: (i) the efficiency of routing manipulation; and (ii) the significant centralization of Bitcoin in terms of mining and routing. Specifically, we find that any network attacker can hijack few ({\textless}100) BGP prefixes to isolate {\textasciitilde}50\% of the mining power---even when considering that mining pools are heavily multi-homed. We also show that on-path network attackers can considerably slow down block propagation by interfering with few key Bitcoin messages. We demonstrate the feasibility of each attack against the deployed Bitcoin software. We also quantify their effectiveness on the current Bitcoin topology using data collected from a Bitcoin supernode combined with BGP routing data. The potential damage to Bitcoin is worrying. By isolating parts of the network or delaying block propagation, attackers can cause a significant amount of mining power to be wasted, leading to revenue losses and enabling a wide range of exploits such as double spending. To prevent such effects in practice, we provide both short and long-term countermeasures, some of which can be deployed immediately.},

	abstract = {In large introductory programming classes, teacher feedback on individual incorrect student submissions is often infeasible. Program synthesis techniques are capable of fixing student bugs and generating hints automatically, but they lack the deep domain knowledge of a teacher and can generate functionally correct but stylistically poor fixes. We introduce a mixed-initiative approach which combines teacher expertise with data-driven program synthesis techniques. We demonstrate our novel approach in two systems that use different interaction mechanisms. Our systems use program synthesis to learn bug-fixing code transformations and then cluster incorrect submissions by the transformations that correct them. The MistakeBrowser system learns transformations from examples of students fixing bugs in their own submissions. The FixPropagator system learns transformations from teachers fixing bugs in incorrect student submissions. Teachers can write feedback about a single submission or a cluster of submissions and propagate the feedback to all other submissions that can be fixed by the same transformation. Two studies suggest this approach helps teachers better understand student bugs and write reusable feedback that scales to a massive introductory programming classroom.},

Despite a large number of behavioral studies that demonstrated gender differences in Raven's Matrices reasoning ability, no neural evidence supported this difference. In this study, voxel-based morphometry (VBM) was used in an attempt to uncover the gender-specific neural basis of Raven's Matrices reasoning ability as measured by the combined Raven's Matrices test (CRT) in 370 healthy young adults. The behavioral results showed no difference between males and females. However, the VBM results showed that the relationship between reasoning ability and regional gray matter volume (rGMV) differed between sexes. The association between CRT scores and rGMV in the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (associated with visuospatial ability) was significantly greater in males than in females, whereas the reverse was true for the inferior frontal cortex (relating to verbal reasoning ability) and the medial frontal cortex (engaged in information binding) where the association was greater in females. These findings suggest that males and females use differently structured brains in different ways to achieve similar levels of overall Raven's Matrices reasoning ability.},

Our Mirage prototype compiles OCaml code into unikernels that run on commodity clouds and offer an order of magnitude reduction in code size without significant performance penalty. The architecture combines static type-safety with a single address-space layout that can be made immutable via a hypervisor extension.

Intuitively, the difference is that tracing operates on live objects, or "matter", while reference counting operates on dead objects, or "anti-matter". For every operation performed by the tracing collector, there is a precisely corresponding anti-operation performed by the reference counting collector.Using this framework, we show that all high-performance collectors (for example, deferred reference counting and generational collection) are in fact hybrids of tracing and reference counting. We develop a uniform cost-model for the collectors to quantify the trade-offs that result from choosing different hybridizations of tracing and reference counting. This allows the correct scheme to be selected based on system performance requirements and the expected properties of the target application.},

Observations and simulations of this component of galaxies suggest that it is a multiphase medium characterized by rich dynamics and complex ionization states. The CGM is a source for a galaxy's star-forming fuel, the venue for galactic feedback and recycling, and perhaps the key regulator of the galactic gas supply. We review our evolving knowledge of the CGM with emphasis on its mass, dynamical state, and coevolution with galaxies. Observations from all redshifts and from across the electromagnetic spectrum indicate that CGM gas has a key role in galaxy evolution. We summarize the state of this field and pose unanswered questions for future research.},

	abstract = {This paper presents SGXPECTRE Attacks that exploit the recently disclosed CPU bugs to subvert the confidential-ity of SGX enclaves. Particularly, we show that when branch prediction of the enclave code can be influenced by programs outside the enclave, the control flow of the enclave program can be temporarily altered to execute instructions that lead to observable cache-state changes. An adversary observing such changes can learn secrets inside the enclave memory or its internal registers, thus completely defeating the confidentiality guarantee of-fered by SGX. To demonstrate the practicality of our SGXPECTRE Attacks, we have systematically explored the possible attack vectors of branch target injection, ap-proaches to win the race condition during enclave's spec-ulative execution, and techniques to automatically search for code patterns required for launching the attacks. Our study suggests that any enclave program could be vul-nerable to SGXPECTRE Attacks since the desired code patterns are available in most SGX runtimes (e.g., Intel SGX SDK, Rust-SGX, and Graphene-SGX).},

This is efficient from a hardware interface perspec-tive, however, it results in consuming valuable bandwidth that is never utilized by the core; this hidden bandwidth is effectively dark to the sys-tem. The causes of dark bandwidth are systemic, built into the very core of our virtual memory abstractions and memory interfaces. Continued focus on newer, revolutionary memory technologies to improve surface performance characteristics without a systems focus on reducing data movement will simply push this problem off onto future systems. This paper examines the problem of dark bandwidth and offers a holistic ap-proach to reduce overall data movement within future compute systems. 1 The Problem Computation is typically not the bottleneck that it once was. Computing itself is faster and less hungry (in terms of energy [7]) than the memory and interconnect that supply the data for computation. Much computing research has focused on providing efficient compute, resulting in the compute cores found in today's CPU sockets. The aforementioned compute devices perform very well for SPEC [4] and LINPACK [3] workloads, however, the compute devices and accompanying sub-systems optimized for these workloads do not necessarily perform well for the applications executed by many HPC [2] and big data systems [12]. Two things are clear: first, architecture researchers have produced a myriad of ways to compute things efficiently, and second, research into ways to feed compute has not kept up. The technical community has been working on a false thesis: that compute systems efficiently utilize the bandwidth provided to the core by the memory subsystem.},

	abstract = {Event processing applications from financial fraud detection to health care analytics continuously execute event queries with Kleene closure to extract event sequences of arbitrary, statically unknown length, called Complete Event Trends (CETs). Due to common event sub-sequences in CETs, ei- ther the responsiveness is delayed by repeated computations or an exorbitant amount of memory is required to store partial results. To overcome these limitations, we define the CET graph to compactly encode all CETs matched by a query. Based on the graph, we define the spectrum of CET detection algorithms from CPU-optimal to memory- optimal. We find the middle ground between these two ex- tremes by partitioning the graph into time-centric graphlets and caching partial CETs per graphlet to enable effective reuse of these intermediate results. We reveal cost mono- tonicity properties of the search space of graph partition- ing plans. Our CET optimizer leverages these properties to prune significant portions of the search to produce a parti- tioning plan with minimal CPU costs yet within the given memory limit. Our experimental study demonstrates that our CET detection solution achieves up to 42–fold speed- up even under rigid memory constraints compared to the state-of-the-art techniques in diverse scenarios.},

First, we present a novel flaw in TLS that allows a man-in-the-middle to downgrade connections to “export-grade” Diffie-Hellman. To carry out this attack, we implement the number field sieve discrete log algorithm. After a week-long precomputation for a specified 512-bit group, we can compute arbitrary discrete logs in this group in minutes. We find that 82\% of vulnerable servers use a single 512-bit group, allowing us to compromise connections to 7\% of Alexa Top Million HTTPS sites. In response, major browsers are being changed to reject short groups. We go on to consider Diffie-Hellman with 768- and 1024-bit groups. A small number of fixed or standardized groups are in use by millions of TLS, SSH, and VPN servers. Performing precomputations on a few of these groups would allow a passive eavesdropper to decrypt a large fraction of Internet traffic. In the 1024-bit case, we estimate that such computations are plausible given nation-state resources, and a close reading of published NSA leaks shows that the agency’s attacks on VPNs are consistent with having achieved such a break. We conclude that moving to stronger key exchange methods should be a priority for the Internet community.},

But providing memory management support for such data structures without foiling their progress guarantees is difficult. Often, designers employ the hazard pointers technique, which may impose a high performance overhead. In this work we propose a novel memory management scheme for lock-free data structures called optimistic access. This scheme provides efficient support for lock-free data structures that can be presented in the normalized form of [24] . Our novel memory manager breaks the traditional memory management invariant which never lets a program touch reclaimed memory. In other words, it allows the memory manager to reclaim objects that may still be accessed later by concurrently running threads. This broken invariant provides an opportunity to obtain high parallelism with excellent performance, but it also requires a careful design. The optimistic access memory management scheme is easy to employ and we implemented it for a linked list, a hash table, and a skip list. Measurements show that it dramatically outperforms known memory reclamation methods.},

Our second result extends our earlier \${\textbackslash}Omega(n{\textasciicircum}\{3/2\})\$ lower bound to the wider class of planar electrical transformations, which preserve the planarity of the graph but may delete cycles that are not faces of the given embedding. This new lower bound follows from the observation that the defect of the medial graph of a planar graph is the same for all its planar embeddings.},

While these formalisms are of immense practical use, they can only model finite alphabets, and since many real-world applications operate over infinite domains such as integers, this is often a limitation. To overcome this problem we augment tree automata and transducers with symbolic alphabets represented as parametric theories. Admitting infinite alphabets makes these models more general and succinct than their classical counterparts. Despite this, we show how the main operations, such as composition and language equivalence, remain computable given a decision procedure for the alphabet theory. We introduce a high-level language called FAST that acts as a front-end for the above formalisms. FAST supports symbolic alphabets through tight integration with state-of-the-art satisfiability modulo theory (SMT) solvers. We demonstrate our techniques on practical case studies, covering a wide range of applications.},

Some require specialized hardware, or cannot support commodity operating systems. Some target 100\% binary compatibility at the expense of performance. Others sacrifice security or functionality for speed. Few offer resource isolation or performance guarantees; most provide only best-effort provisioning, risking denial of service.This paper presents Xen, an x86 virtual machine monitor which allows multiple commodity operating systems to share conventional hardware in a safe and resource managed fashion, but without sacrificing either performance or functionality. This is achieved by providing an idealized virtual machine abstraction to which operating systems such as Linux, BSD and Windows XP, can be ported with minimal effort.Our design is targeted at hosting up to 100 virtual machine instances simultaneously on a modern server. The virtualization approach taken by Xen is extremely efficient: we allow operating systems such as Linux and Windows XP to be hosted simultaneously for a negligible performance overhead --- at most a few percent compared with the unvirtualized case. We considerably outperform competing commercial and freely available solutions in a range of microbenchmarks and system-wide tests.},

The book is divided into three parts: the first is devoted to hyperbolic geometry, the second to surfaces, and the third to three-manifolds. It contains complete proofs of Mostow's rigidity, the thick-thin decomposition, Thurston's classification of the diffeomorphisms of surfaces (via Bonahon's geodesic currents), the prime and JSJ decomposition, the topological and geometric classification of Seifert manifolds, and Thurston's hyperbolic Dehn filling Theorem.},

While object identity is fundamental to object-oriented systems, object equality, although tightly intertwined with identity, is harder to pin down. The distinction between identity and equality is reflected in object-oriented languages, almost all of which provide two variants of "equality", while some provide many more. Programmers can usually override at least one of these forms of equality, and can always define their own methods to distinguish their own objects. This essay takes a reflexive journey through fifty years of identity and equality in object-oriented languages, and ends somewhere we did not expect: A "left-handed" equality relying on trust and grace.},

	abstract = {Predicting the binding mode of flexible polypeptides to proteins is an important task that falls outside the domain of applicability of most small molecule and protein−protein docking tools. Here, we test the small molecule flexible ligand docking program Glide on a set of 19 non-α-helical peptides and systematically improve pose prediction accuracy by enhancing Glide sampling for flexible polypeptides. In addition, scoring of the poses was improved by post-processing with physics-based implicit solvent MM- GBSA calculations. Using the best RMSD among the top 10 scoring poses as a metric, the success rate (RMSD ≤ 2.0 Å for the interface backbone atoms) increased from 21\% with default Glide SP settings to 58\% with the enhanced peptide sampling and scoring protocol in the case of redocking to the native protein structure. This approaches the accuracy of the recently developed Rosetta FlexPepDock method (63\% success for these 19 peptides) while being over 100 times faster. Cross-docking was performed for a subset of cases where an unbound receptor structure was available, and in that case, 40\% of peptides were docked successfully. We analyze the results and find that the optimized polypeptide protocol is most accurate for extended peptides of limited size and number of formal charges, defining a domain of applicability for this approach.},

Rich statistical data distilled from combining such interactions in near real- time generates enormous business value. In this paper, we describe the architecture of Photon, a geographically dis- tributed system for joining multiple continuously flowing streams of data in real-time with high scalability and low latency, where the streams may be unordered or delayed. The system fully tolerates infrastructure degradation and datacenter-level outages without any manual intervention. Photon guarantees that there will be no duplicates in the joined output (at-most-once semantics) at any point in time, that most joinable events will be present in the output in real-time (near-exact semantics), and exactly-once seman- tics eventually. Photon is deployed within Google Advertising System to join data streams such as web search queries and user clicks on advertisements. It produces joined logs that are used to derive key business metrics, including billing for advertisers. Our production deployment processes millions of events per minute at peak with an average end-to-end latency of less than 10 seconds. We also present challenges and solutions in maintaining large persistent state across geographically distant locations, and highlight the design principles that emerged from our experience.

Previous work has shown that wavelet-based his-tograms provide more accurate selectivity estima-tion than traditional histograms, such as equi-depth histograms. But since wavelet-based histograms are built by a nontrivial mathematical procedure, namely, w a v elet transform decomposition, it is hard to maintain the accuracy of the histogram when the underlying data distribution changes over time. In particular, simple techniques, such as split and merge, which w orks well for equi-depth histograms, and updating a set of wavelet coeecients, are not suitable here. We propose a novel approach based upon proba-bilistic counting and sampling to maintain wavelet-based histograms with very little online time and space costs. The accuracy of our method is robust to changing data distributions, and we get a consid-erable improvement o v er previous methods for up-dating transform-based histograms. A v ery nice fea-ture of our method is that it can be extended nat-urally to maintain multidimensional wavelet-based histograms, while traditional multidimensional his-tograms can be less accurate and prohibitively ex-pensive to build and maintain.},

The master station transmits a continuous, coded signal in a certain direction and angle, at a predetermined power level. When a meteor appears with appropriate trajectory, it reflects the signal from the master station back down to the earth to the remote station. The remote station decodes the signal, turns on its own transmitter, and sends a response signal back along the trajectory path to the master station. Data can then be exchanged.

We present a defense against coercion attacks using the concept of implicit learning from cognitive psychology. Implicit learning refers to learning of patterns without any conscious knowledge of the learned pattern. We use a carefully crafted computer game to plant a secret password in the participant’s brain without the participant having any conscious knowledge of the trained password. While the planted secret can be used for authentication, the participant cannot be coerced into revealing it since he or she has no conscious knowledge of it. We performed a number of user studies using Amazon’s Mechanical Turk to verify that participants can successfully reauthenticate over time and that they are unable to reconstruct or even recognize short fragments of the planted secret.},

The fisherman used one of the signing tokens to sign the document "give me a castle!" and rushed to the palace. The king executed the classical verification algorithm using the fish's public key, and since it was valid, the king complied. The fisherman's wife wanted to sign ten wishes using their two remaining signing tokens. The fisherman did not want to cheat, and secretly sailed to meet the fish. "Fish, my wife wants to sign ten more wishes". But the fish was not worried: "I have learned quantum cryptography following the previous story (The Fisherman and His Wife by the brothers Grimm). The quantum tokens are consumed during the signing. Your polynomial wife cannot even sign four wishes using the three signing tokens I gave you". "How does it work?" wondered the fisherman. "Have you heard of quantum money? These are quantum states which can be easily verified but are hard to copy. This tokenized quantum signature scheme extends Aaronson and Christiano's quantum money scheme, which is why the signing tokens cannot be copied". "Does your scheme have additional fancy properties?" the fisherman asked. "Yes, the scheme has other security guarantees: revocability, testability and everlasting security. Furthermore, if you're at sea and your quantum phone has only classical reception, you can use this scheme to transfer the value of the quantum money to shore", said the fish, and swam away.},

	abstract = {What can humans compute in their heads? We are thinking of a variety of Crypto Protocols, games like Sudoku, Crossword Puzzles, Speed Chess, and so on. The intent of this paper is to apply the ideas and methods of theoretical computer science to better understand what humans can compute in their heads. For example, can a person compute a function in their head so that an eavesdropper with a powerful computer --- who sees the responses to random input --- still cannot infer responses to new inputs? To address such questions, we propose a rigorous model of human computation and associated measures of complexity. We apply the model and measures first and foremost to the problem of (1) humanly computable password generation, and then consider related problems of (2) humanly computable "one-way functions" and (3) humanly computable "pseudorandom generators". The theory of Human Computability developed here plays by different rules than standard computability, and this takes some getting used to. For reasons to be made clear, the polynomial versus exponential time divide of modern computability theory is irrelevant to human computation. In human computability, the step-counts for both humans and computers must be more concrete. Specifically, we restrict the adversary to at most 10{\textasciicircum}24 (Avogadro number of) steps. An alternate view of this work is that it deals with the analysis of algorithms and counting steps for the case that inputs are small as opposed to the usual case of inputs large-in-the-limit.},

With the rise of interest in quantum cryptography and quantum computation, it became clear that there is extensive network of analogies between physics, topology, logic and computation.

During the deployment, the network recorded 229 earthquakes, eruptions, and other seismoacoustic events. The science requirements of reliable data collection, accurate event detection, and high timing precision drive sensor networks in new directions for geophysical monitoring. The main contribution of this paper is an evaluation of the sensor network as a scientific instrument, holding it to the standards of existing instrumentation in terms of data fidelity (the quality and accuracy of the recorded signals) and yield (the quantity of the captured data). We describe an approach to time rectification of the acquired signals that can recover accurate timing despite failures of the underlying time synchronization protocol.

	abstract = {Massive multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) has been extensively
studied and considered as a key enabling technology for the fifth
generation (5G) wireless communication systems, due to its potential to
achieve high energy efficiency and spectral efficiency. As the concept
of massive MIMO becomes more popular, it is plausible that the
eavesdroppers will also employ massive antennas, which may remarkably
enhance their ability to intercept the information. In this paper,
motivated by the need to protect against the eavesdroppers equipped with
powerful large antenna arrays, which has received scarce attention in
the literature, a physical layer security approach called original
symbol phase rotated (OSPR) secure transmission scheme is proposed to
defend against eavesdroppers armed with unlimited antennas. The basic
idea of the proposed OSPR scheme is to randomly rotate the phase of
original symbols at the base station (BS) before they are transmitted,
so that the massive MIMO eavesdropper will be confused by the
intercepted signals, which may not represent the true information
symbols. However, the legitimate users are able to infer the correct
phase rotations and take proper inverse operations to recover the
original symbols. We show that when the BS has a large enough, but
finite number of antennas, the proposed OSPR scheme can achieve a
considerable security performance in that the eavesdropper is unable to
recover most of the original symbols, even with unlimited antennas. The
process and the security performance of the proposed OSPR scheme are
presented in detail. Simulation results are provided to further
corroborate that the proposed OSPR scheme is a potential green secure
transmission candidate technique for the future wireless networks.},

	abstract = {As humans, we perceive the three-dimensional structure of the world around us with apparent ease. However, despite all of the recent advances in computer vision research, the dream of having a computer interpret an image at the same level as a two-year old remains elusive. Why is computer vision such a challenging problem, and what is the current state of the art?Computer Vision: Algorithms and Applications explores the variety of techniques commonly used to analyze and interpret images. It also describes challenging real-world applications where vision is being successfully used, both for specialized applications such as medical imaging and fun consumer-level tasks such as image editing and stitching, which students can apply to their own personal photos and videos.More than just a source of "recipes", this text/reference also takes a scientific approach to basic vision problems, formulating physical models of the imaging process before inverting this process to produce the best possible descriptions of a scene. Exercises are presented throughout the book, with a heavy emphasis on testing algorithms.Suitable for either an undergraduate or a graduate-level course in computer vision, this textbook focuses on basic techniques that work under real-world conditions and encourages students to push their creative boundaries.Dr. Richard Szeliski has over twenty years' experience in computer vision research, most notably at Digital Equipment Corporation and Microsoft.},

	abstract = {Packet processing is the enabling technology of networked information systems such as the Internet and is usually performed with fixed-function custom-made ASIC chips. As communication protocols evolve rapidly, there is increasing interest in adapting features of the processing over time and, since software is the preferred way of expressing complex computation, we are interested in finding a platform to execute packet processing software with the best possible throughput. Because FPGAs are widely used in network equipment and they can implement processors, we are motivated to investigate executing software directly on the FPGAs. Off-the-shelf soft processors on FPGA fabric are currently geared towards performing embedded sequential tasks and, in contrast, network processing is most often inherently parallel between packet flows, if not between each individual packet. Our goal is to allow multiple threads of execution in an FPGA to reach a higher aggregate throughput than commercially available shared-memory soft multi-processors via improvements to the underlying soft processor architecture. We study a number of processor pipeline organizations to identify which ones can scale to a larger number of execution threads and find that tuning multithreaded pipelines can provide compact cores with high throughput. We then perform a design space exploration of multicore soft systems, compare single-threaded and multithreaded designs to identify scalability limits and develop processor architectures allowing threads to execute with as little architectural stalls as possible: in particular with instruction replay and static hazard detection mechanisms. To further reduce the wait times, we allow threads to speculatively execute by leveraging transactional memory. Our multithreaded multiprocessor along with our compilation and simulation framework makes the FPGA easy to use for an average programmer who can write an application as a single thread of computation with coarse-grained synchronization around shared data structures. Comparing with multithreaded processors using lock-based synchronization, we measure up to 57\% additional throughput with the use of transactional-memory-based synchronization. Given our applications, gigabit interfaces and 125 MHz system clock rate, our results suggest that soft processors can process packets in software at high throughput and low latency, while capitalizing on the FPGAs already available in network equipment.},

	abstract = {Synaptic loss and dysfunction as well as neuronal accumulation of amyloid-β (Aβ) are classic features of Alzheimer’s disease (AD). Synaptic components are transported along axons in actin- and synapsin-associated vesicles to adjust synaptic strength in response to activity and to promote the formation of new synapses. Using hippocampal neurons isolated from rats and mouse models of AD, Park et al. found that a soluble form of Aβ impedes Ca2+ clearance from neurons, which led to activation of the kinase CaMKIV. CaMKIV-mediated phosphorylation of synapsin caused its dissociation from synaptic vesicles and actin, thereby impairing vesicular transport. Targeting this pathway might suppress the pathological effects of Aβ in patients with AD.The prefibrillar form of soluble amyloid-β (sAβ1–42) impairs synaptic function and is associated with the early phase of Alzheimer’s disease (AD). We investigated how sAβ1–42 led to presynaptic defects using a quantum dot–based, single particle–tracking method to monitor synaptic vesicle (SV) trafficking along axons. We found that sAβ1–42 prevented new synapse formation induced by chemical long-term potentiation (cLTP). In cultured rat hippocampal neurons, nanomolar amounts of sAβ1–42 impaired Ca2+ clearance from presynaptic terminals and increased the basal Ca2+ concentration. This caused an increase in the phosphorylation of Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase IV (CaMKIV) and its substrate synapsin, which markedly inhibited SV trafficking along axons between synapses. Neurons derived from a transgenic AD mouse model had similar defects, which were prevented by an inhibitor of CaMK kinase (CaMKK; which activates CaMKIV), by antibodies against Aβ1–42, or by expression a phosphodeficient synapsin mutant. The CaMKK inhibitor also abolished the defects in activity-dependent synaptogenesis caused by sAβ1–42. Our results suggest that by disrupting SV reallocation between synapses, sAβ1–42 prevents neurons from forming new synapses or adjusting strength and activity among neighboring synapses. Targeting this mechanism might prevent synaptic dysfunction in AD patients.},

The exercises require relatively extensive arguments, creative approaches, or both, thus providing motivation for the reader. With a unified approach to a diverse collection of topics, this text points out connections, similarities, and differences among subjects whenever possible. This book shows students that mathematics is a vibrant and dynamic human enterprise by including historical perspectives and notes on the giants of mathematics, by mentioning current activity in the mathematical community, and by discussing many famous and less well-known questions that remain open for future mathematicians. Ideally, this text should be used for a two semester course, where the first course has no prerequisites and the second is a more challenging course for math majors; yet, the flexible structure of the book allows it to be used in a variety of settings, including as a source of various independent-study and research projects.},

	abstract = {Paxos is probably the most popular state machine replication protocol. Two optimizations that can greatly improve its performance are batching and pipelining. However, tuning these two optimizations to achieve high-throughput can be challenging, as their effectiveness depends on many parameters like the network latency and bandwidth, the speed of the nodes, and the properties of the application. We address this question by presenting an analytical model of the performance of Paxos, and showing how it can be used to determine configuration values for the batching and pipelining optimizations that result in high-throughput. We then validate the model, by presenting the results of experiments where we investigate the interaction of these two optimizations both in LAN and WAN environments, and comparing these results with the prediction from the model. The results confirm the accuracy of the model, with the predicted values being usually very close to the ones that provide the highest performance in the experiments. Furthermore, both the model and the experiments give useful insights into the relative effectiveness of batching and pipelining. They show that although batching by itself provides the largest gains in all scenarios, in most cases combining it with pipelining provides a very significant additional increase in throughput, with this being true not only on high-latency WAN but also in many LAN scenarios. © 2012 Elsevier B.V.

It argues all these are in fact inessential; rather, it traces C's ultimate strength to a communicative design which does not fit easily within the usual conception of " a programming language " , but can be seen as a counterpoint to so-called " managed languages " . This communicativity is what facilitates the essential aspect of system-building: creating parts which interact with other, remote parts—being " alongside " not " within " .},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Visuo-spatial and problem-solving abilities are commonly impaired in patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD). Conversely, subjects with amnestic mild cognitive impairment (aMCI) do not exhibit overt involvement of cognitive domains other than memory. Consequently, a detection of an impairment at the Raven's colored progressive matrices (RCPM) could be useful to discriminate aMCI from AD and to mark the progression from one condition to another. AIM OF THE STUDY: To describe the pattern of errors at RCPM in subjects suffering from AD as compared with that of aMCI. METHODS: Fifteen patients with AD, 15 subjects with aMCI and 31 Healthy Controls (HC) received the RCPM. The errors were classified as: (1) difference (D); (2) inadequate individuation (II); (3) repetition of the pattern (RP); (4) incomplete correlation (IC). RESULTS: No difference approached significance between aMCI subjects and HC. AD patients always exhibited a higher number of errors as compared with HC. AD patients showed higher number of errors as compared with aMCI only on RP and IC errors. CONCLUSIONS: The results suggest that the visuo-spatial and problem-solving impairment that characterize AD, and probably subtend the progression from aMCI to dementia, do not affect to the same extent all cognitive dimensions explored by RCPM.},

	abstract = {People with autism spectrum condition (ASC) perform well on Raven's matrices, a test which loads highly on the general factor in intelligence. However, the mechanisms supporting enhanced performance on the test are poorly understood. Evidence is accumulating that milder variants of the ASC phenotype are present in typically developing individuals, and that those who are further along the autistic-like trait spectrum show similar patterns of abilities and impairments as people with clinically diagnosed ASC. We investigated whether self-reported autistic-like traits in a university student sample, assessed using the Autism-Spectrum Quotient (AQ; Baron-Cohen, Wheelwright, Skinner, et al., 2001), predict performance on Raven's Advanced Progressive Matrices. We found that reporting poorer social skills but better attention switching predicted a higher Advanced matrices score overall. DeShon, Chan, and Weissbein (1995) classified Advanced matrices items as requiring a visuospatial, or a verbal-analytic strategy. We hypothesised that higher AQ scores would predict better performance on visuospatial items than on verbal-analytic items. This prediction was confirmed. These results are consistent with the continuum view and can be explained by the enhanced perceptual functioning theory of performance peaks in ASC. The results also confirm a new prediction about Raven's Advanced Progressive Matrices performance in people with ASC.},

The problem of constructing a wait-free implementation of one data object from another lies at the heart of much recent work in concurrent algorithms, concurrent data structures, and multiprocessor architectures. First, we introduce a simple and general technique, based on reduction to a concensus protocol, for proving statements of the form, there is no wait-free implementation of X by Y. We derive a hierarchy of objects such that no object at one level has a wait-free implementation in terms of objects at lower levels. In particular, we show that atomic read/write registers, which have been the focus of much recent attention, are at the bottom of the hierarchy: thay cannot be used to construct wait-free implementations of many simple and familiar data types. Moreover, classical synchronization primitives such astest\&set and fetch\&add, while more powerful than read and write, are also computationally weak, as are the standard message-passing primitives. Second, nevertheless, we show that there do exist simple universal objects from which one can construct a wait-free implementation of any sequential object.},

	abstract = {In this work, we examine the feasibility of secure and undetectable point-to-point com-munication in a world where governments can read all the encrypted communications of their citizens. We consider a world where the only permitted method of communication is via a government-mandated encryption scheme, instantiated with government-mandated keys. Parties cannot simply encrypt ciphertexts of some other encryption scheme, because citizens caught trying to communicate outside the government's knowledge (e.g., by encrypt-ing strings which do not appear to be natural language plaintexts) will be arrested. The one guarantee we suppose is that the government mandates an encryption scheme which is semantically secure against outsiders: a perhaps reasonable supposition when a government might consider it advantageous to secure its people's communication against foreign entities. But then, what good is semantic security against an adversary that holds all the keys and has the power to decrypt? We show that even in the pessimistic scenario described, citizens can communicate se-curely and undetectably. In our terminology, this translates to a positive statement: all semantically secure encryption schemes support subliminal communication. Informally, this means that there is a two-party protocol between Alice and Bob where the parties exchange ciphertexts of what appears to be a normal conversation even to someone who knows the secret keys and thus can read the corresponding plaintexts. And yet, at the end of the protocol, Alice will have transmitted her secret message to Bob. Our security definition requires that the adversary not be able to tell whether Alice and Bob are just having a nor-mal conversation using the mandated encryption scheme, or they are using the mandated encryption scheme for subliminal communication. Our topics may be thought to fall broadly within the realm of steganography: the sci-ence of hiding secret communication within innocent-looking messages, or cover objects. However, we deal with the non-standard setting of an adversarially chosen distribution of cover objects (i.e., a stronger-than-usual adversary), and we take advantage of the fact that our cover objects are ciphertexts of a semantically secure encryption scheme to bypass im-possibility results which we show for broader classes of steganographic schemes. We give several constructions of subliminal communication schemes under the assumption that key exchange protocols with pseudorandom messages exist (such as Diffie-Hellman, which in fact has truly random messages). Each construction leverages the assumed semantic security of the adversarially chosen encryption scheme, in order to achieve subliminal communication.},

Recent evidence has suggested that the relationship between a fluid abilities test, Raven's Progressive Matrices, and working memory capacity (WMC) may be invariant across difficulty levels of the Raven's items. We show that this invariance can only be observed if the overall correlation between Raven's and WMC is low. Simulations of Raven's performance revealed that as the overall correlation between Raven's and WMC increases, the item-wise point bi-serial correlations involving WMC are no longer constant but increase considerably with item difficulty. The simulation results were confirmed by two studies that used a composite measure of WMC, which yielded a higher correlation between WMC and Raven's than reported in previous studies. As expected, with the higher overall correlation, there was a significant positive relationship between Raven's item difficulty and the extent of the item-wise correlation with WMC.},

	abstract = {The growing popularity of the JSON format has fueled increased interest in loading and processing JSON data within analytical data processing systems. However, in many applications, JSON pars-ing dominates performance and cost. In this paper, we present a new JSON parser called Mison that is particularly tailored to this class of applications, by pushing down both projection and filter operators of analytical queries into the parser. To achieve these features, we propose to deviate from the traditional approach of building parsers using finite state machines (FSMs). Instead, we follow a two-level approach that enables the parser to jump di-rectly to the correct position of a queried field without having to perform expensive tokenizing steps to find the field. At the upper level, Mison speculatively predicts the logical locations of queried fields based on previously seen patterns in a dataset. At the lower level, Mison builds structural indices on JSON data to map logi-cal locations to physical locations. Unlike all existing FSM-based parsers, building structural indices converts control flow into data flow, thereby largely eliminating inherently unpredictable branches in the program and exploiting the parallelism available in modern processors. We experimentally evaluate Mison using representative real-world JSON datasets and the TPC-H benchmark, and show that Mison produces significant performance benefits over the best existing JSON parsers; in some cases, the performance improve-ment is over one order of magnitude.},

Based on these rules we find that optimized linear networks typically control chemotaxis by computing the first time-derivative of the chemical concentration and modulating the body turning rate in response to this derivative.

We present Procrastinator, which automatically decides when to fetch each network object that an app requests. This decision is made based on whether the user is on Wi-Fi or cellular, how many bytes are remaining on the user's data plan, and whether the object is needed at the present time. Procrastinator does not require developer effort, nor app source code, nor OS changes -- it modifies the app binary to trap specific system calls and inject custom code. Our system can achieve as little as no savings to 4X savings in bytes transferred, depending on the user and the app. In theory, we can achieve 17X savings, but we need to overcome additional technical challenges.},

Microplastics were absent in one brand while others contained between 1 to 10 MPs/Kg of salt. Out of the 72 extracted particles, 41.6\% were plastic polymers, 23.6\% were pigments, 5.50\% were amorphous carbon, and 29.1\% remained unidentified. The particle size (mean ± SD) was 515 ± 171 μm. The most common plastic polymers were polypropylene (40.0\%) and polyethylene (33.3\%). Fragments were the primary form of MPs (63.8\%) followed by filaments (25.6\%) and films (10.6\%). According to our results, the low level of anthropogenic particles intake from the salts (maximum 37 particles per individual per annum) warrants negligible health impacts. However, to better understand the health risks associated with salt consumption, further development in extraction protocols are needed to isolate anthropogenic particles smaller than 149 μm.},

	abstract = {Relaxed Radix Balanced Trees (RRB-Trees) is one of the latest members in a family of persistent tree based data-structures that combine wide branching factors with simple and relatively flat structures. Like the battle-tested immutable sequences of Clojure and Scala, they have effectively constant lookup and updates, good cache utilization, but also logarithmic concatenation and slicing. Our goal is to bring the benefits of func-tional data structures to the discipline of systems programming via generic yet efficient immutable vectors supporting transient batch updates. We describe a C++ implementation that can be integrated in the runtime of higher level languages with a C core (Lisps like Guile or Racket, but also Python or Ruby), thus widening the access to these persistent data structures. In this work we propose (1) an Embedding RRB-Tree (ERRB-Tree) data structure that efficiently stores arbitrary unboxed types, (2) a technique for implementing tree operations independent of optimizations for a more compact representation of the tree, (3) a policy-based design to support multiple memory management and reclamation mechanisms (including automatic garbage collection and reference counting), (4) a model of transience based on move-semantics and reference counting, and (5) a definition of transience for confluent meld operations. Combining these techniques a performance comparable to that of mutable arrays can be achieved in many situations, while using the data structure in a functional way.},

	abstract = {In the early Universe, while galaxies were still forming, black holes as massive as a billion solar masses powered quasars. Supermassive black holes are found at the centres of most galaxies today1–3 , where their masses are related to the velocity dispersions of stars in their host galaxies and hence to the mass of the central bulge of the galaxy4,5 . This suggests a link between the growth of the black holes and their host galaxies6–9 , which has indeed been assumed for a number of years. But the origin of the observed relation between black hole mass and stellar velocity dispersion, and its connection with the evolution of galaxies, have remained unclear. Here we report simulations that simul- taneously follow star formation and the growth of black holes during galaxy–galaxy collisions. We find that, in addition to generating a burst of star formation10 ,a merger leadsto strong inflows that feed gas to the supermassive black hole and thereby power the quasar. The energy released by the quasar expels enough gas to quench both star formation and further black hole growth. This determines the lifetime of the quasar phase (approaching 100 million years) and explains the relation- ship between the black hole mass and the stellar velocity dispersion.},

A simple learning procedure is shown to be sufficient for the organization of some essential functional properties of single units. The rather special assumptions usually made in the literature regarding preorganization of the visual cortex are thereby avoided. The model consists of 338 neurones forming a sheet analogous to the cortex. The neurones are connected randomly to a "retina" of 19 cells. Nine different stimuli in the form of light bars were applied. The afferent connections were modified according to a mechanism of synaptic training. After twenty presentations of all the stimuli individual cortical neurones became sensitive to only one orien-tation. Neurones with the same or similar orientation sensitivity tended to appear in clusters, which are analogous to cortical columns. The system was shown to be insensitive to a background of disturbing input excitations during learning. After learning it was able to repair small defects introduced into the wiring and was relatively insensitive to stimuli not used during training.},

	abstract = {Cryptocurrencies record transactions in a decentralized data structure called a blockchain. Two of the most popular cryptocurrencies, Bitcoin and Ethereum, support the fea-ture to encode rules or scripts for processing transactions. This feature has evolved to give practical shape to the ideas of smart contracts, or full-fledged programs that are run on blockchains. Recently, Ethereum's smart contract system has seen steady adoption, supporting tens of thousands of contracts, holding millions dollars worth of virtual coins. In this paper, we investigate the security of running smart contracts based on Ethereum in an open distributed network like those of cryptocurrencies. We introduce several new se-curity problems in which an adversary can manipulate smart contract execution to gain profit. These bugs suggest subtle gaps in the understanding of the distributed semantics of the underlying platform. As a refinement, we propose ways to enhance the operational semantics of Ethereum to make con-tracts less vulnerable. For developers writing contracts for the existing Ethereum system, we build a symbolic execution tool called Oyente to find potential security bugs. Among 19, 366 existing Ethereum contracts, Oyente flags 8, 833 of them as vulnerable, including the TheDAO bug which led to a 60 million US dollar loss in June 2016. We also discuss the severity of other attacks for several case studies which have source code available and confirm the attacks (which target only our accounts) in the main Ethereum network.},

" Yet the mindfulness movement and empirical evidence supporting it have not gone without criticism. Misinformation and poor methodology associated with past studies of mindfulness may lead public consumers to be harmed, misled, and disappointed. Addressing such concerns, the present article discusses the difficulties of defining mindfulness, delineates the proper scope of research into mindfulness practices, and explicates crucial methodological issues for interpreting results from investigations of mindfulness. For doing so, the authors draw on their diverse areas of expertise to review the present state of mindfulness research, comprehensively summarizing what we do and do not know, while providing a prescriptive agenda for contemplative science, with a particular focus on assessment, mindfulness training, possible adverse effects, and intersection with brain imaging. Our goals are to inform interested scientists, the news media, and the public, to minimize harm, curb poor research practices, and staunch the flow of misinformation about the benefits, costs, and future prospects of mindfulness meditation.},

	abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater}This article introduces a method of hiding transaction amounts in the strongly decentralized anonymous cryptocurrency Monero. Similar to Bitcoin, Monero is a cryptocurrency which is distributed through a proof-of-work “mining” process having no central party or trusted setup. The original Monero protocol was based on CryptoNote, which uses ring signatures and one-time keys to hide the destination and origin of transactions. Recently the technique of using a commitment scheme to hide the amount of a transaction has been discussed and implemented by Bitcoin Core developer Gregory Maxwell. In this article, a new type of ring signature, A Multilayered Linkable Spontaneous Anonymous Group signature is described which allows one to include a Pedersen Commitment in a ring signature. This construction results in a digital currency with hidden amounts, origins and destinations of transactions with reasonable efficiency and verifiable, trustless coin generation. The author would like to note that early drafts of this were publicized in the Monero Community and on the \#bitcoin-wizards IRC channel. Blockchain hashed drafts are available showing that this work was started in Summer 2015, and completed in early October 2015. An eprint is also available at http://eprint.iacr.org/2015/1098. {\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

	abstract = {In almost all nervous systems, rapid excitatory synaptic communication is mediated by a diversity of ionotropic glutamate receptors. In Caenorhabditis elegans, 10 putative ionotropic glutamate receptor subunits have been identified, a surprising number for an organism with only 302 neurons. Sequence analysis of the predicted proteins identified two NMDA and eight non-NMDA receptor subunits. Here we describe the complete distribution of these subunits in the nervous system of C. elegans. Receptor subunits were found almost exclusively in interneurons and motor neurons, but no expression was detected in muscle cells. Interestingly, some neurons expressed only a single subunit, suggesting that these may form functional homomeric channels. Conversely, interneurons of the locomotory control circuit (AVA, AVB, AVD, AVE, and PVC) coexpressed up to six subunits, suggesting that these subunits interact to generate a diversity of heteromeric glutamate receptor channels that regulate various aspects of worm movement. We also show that expression of these subunits in this circuit is differentially regulated by the homeodomain protein UNC-42 and that UNC-42 is also required for axonal pathfinding of neurons in the circuit. In wild-type worms, the axons of AVA, AVD, and AVE lie in the ventral cord, whereas in unc-42 mutants, the axons are anteriorly, laterally, or dorsally displaced, and the mutant worms have sensory and locomotory defects.},

In particular, we consider the important case where there are many such queries to the same array, A, which resides entirely in RAM. In addition to the obvious sorted order/binary search combination we consider the Eytzinger (BFS) layout normally used for heaps, an implicit B-tree layout that generalizes the Eytzinger layout, and the van Emde Boas layout commonly used in the cache-oblivious algorithms literature. After extensive testing and tuning on a wide variety of modern hardware, we arrive at the conclusion that, for small values of n, sorted order, combined with a good imple-mentation of binary search is best. For larger values of n, we arrive at the surprising conclusion that the Eytzinger layout is usually the fastest. The latter conclusion is un-expected and goes counter to earlier experimental work by Brodal, Fagerberg, and Jacob (SODA 2003), who concluded that both the B-tree and van Emde Boas layouts were faster than the Eytzinger layout for large values of n. Our fastest C++ implementations, when compiled, use conditional moves to avoid branch mispredictions and prefetching to reduce cache latency.},

Here, we show that ravens plan for events unrelated to caching—tool-use and bartering—with delays of up to 17 hours, exert self-control, and consider temporal distance to future events. Their performance parallels that seen in apes and suggests that planning evolved independently in corvids, which opens new avenues for the study of cognitive evolution.},

	abstract = {Mycotoxins are small (MW approximately 700), toxic chemical products formed as secondary metabolites by a few fungal species that readily colonise crops and contaminate them with toxins in the field or after harvest. Ochratoxins and Aflatoxins are mycotoxins of major significance and hence there has been significant research on broad range of analytical and detection techniques that could be useful and practical. Due to the variety of structures of these toxins, it is impossible to use one standard technique for analysis and/or detection. Practical requirements for high-sensitivity analysis and the need for a specialist laboratory setting create challenges for routine analysis. Several existing analytical techniques, which offer flexible and broad-based methods of analysis and in some cases detection, have been discussed in this manuscript. There are a number of methods used, of which many are lab-based, but to our knowledge there seems to be no single technique that stands out above the rest, although analytical liquid chromatography, commonly linked with mass spectroscopy is likely to be popular. This review manuscript discusses (a) sample pre-treatment methods such as liquid-liquid extraction (LLE), supercritical fluid extraction (SFE), solid phase extraction (SPE), (b) separation methods such as (TLC), high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC), gas chromatography (GC), and capillary electrophoresis (CE) and (c) others such as ELISA. Further currents trends, advantages and disadvantages and future prospects of these methods have been discussed.},

	abstract = {Researchers are actively exploring techniques to enforce control-flow integrity (CFI), which restricts program exe-cution to a predefined set of targets for each indirect con-trol transfer to prevent code-reuse attacks. While hardware-assisted CFI enforcement may have the potential for ad-vantages in performance and flexibility over software in-strumentation, current hardware-assisted defenses are either incomplete (i.e., do not enforce all control transfers) or less efficient in comparison. We find that the recent introduction of hardware features to log complete control-flow traces, such as Intel Processor Trace (PT), provides an opportunity to explore how efficient and flexible a hardware-assisted CFI enforcement system may become. While Intel PT was de-signed to aid in offline debugging and failure diagnosis, we explore its effectiveness for online CFI enforcement over un-modified binaries by designing a parallelized method for en-forcing various types of CFI policies. We have implemented a prototype called GRIFFIN in the Linux 4.2 kernel that en-ables complete CFI enforcement over a variety of software, including the Firefox browser and its jitted code. Our ex-periments show that GRIFFIN can enforce fine-grained CFI policies with shadow stack as recommended by researchers at a performance that is comparable to software-only instru-mentation techniques. In addition, we find that alternative logging approaches yield significant performance improve-ments for trace processing, identifying opportunities for fur-ther hardware assistance.},

	abstract = {ZeroDB is an end-to-end encrypted database that enables clients to operate on (search, sort, query, and share) encrypted data without exposing encryption keys or cleartext data to the database server. The familiar client-server architecture is unchanged, but query logic and encryption keys are pushed client-side. Since the server has no insight into the nature of the data, the risk of data being exposed via a server-side data breach is eliminated. Even if the server is successfully infiltrated, adversaries would not have access to the cleartext data and cannot derive anything useful out of disk or RAM snapshots. ZeroDB provides end-to-end encryption while maintaining much of the functionality expected of a modern database, such as full-text search, sort, and range queries. Additionally, ZeroDB uses proxy re-encryption and/or delta key technology to enable secure, granular sharing of encrypted data without exposing keys to the server and without sharing the same encryption key between users of the database.},

	abstract = {Abstract - The shrew or RoS attacks are low-rate DDoS attacks that degrade the QoS to end systems slowly but not to deny the services completely. These attacks are more difficult to detect than the flooding type of DDoS attacks. In this paper, we explore the energy distributions of Internet traffic flows in frequency domain. Normal TCP traffic flows present some form of periodicity because of TCP protocol behavior. Our results reveal that normal TCP flows can be segregated from malicious flows using some energy distribution properties. We discover the spectral shifting of attack flows from that of normal flows. Combining flow-level spectral analysis with sequential hypothesis testing, we propose a novel defense scheme against shrew DDoS or RoQ (reduction-of-service) attacks. Our detection and filtering scheme can effectively rescue 99\% legitimate TCP flows under the RoS attacks. Keywords:},

	title = {Stealthy {Dopant}-{Level} {Hardware} {Trojans}},
	abstract = {1 Introduction With the increase in outsourcing manufacturing of integrated circuits to dier-ent countries, the topic of trust and security becomes more and more important. The built circuits could contain some malicious modications introduced dur-ing production, known as hardware trojans. Common ways of detecting these modication include optical inspection with electron-microscopes, comparing side-channel information to a known trojan-free golden chip, and just plain functional testing. This seminar paper, based on [1] by Becker, Regazzoni, Paar, and Burleson, describes a method of implementing hardware trojans on the dopant-level with-out being detectable by the aforementioned methods. The trojans circuits look physically the same as a trojan-free one, with modications in only the physical composition of the materials used. The attack is demonstrated on two case-studies: reducing the quality of random numbers generated by Intel's Ivy Bridge processors random number generator, and introducing a power side-channel to an AES SBox implemented in side-channel resistant logic. To understand the operation of transistors and how these dopant-level hard-ware trojans work, it is rst necessary to have a basic understanding of semicon-ductor dopingthis will be briey introduced in Section 2. Section 3 explains the construction and operation of most transistors used today and how logic gates are built from them. Section 4 describes the dopant-level attack on a simple component and Section 5 gives an overview of the two case studies to see practical applicability of the attack. The last section summarizes the results and gives conclusions. 2 Semiconductor doping Doping involves adding a dopant agent to a semiconductor, introducing impu-rities to the material and giving it dierent electrical properties than a pure semiconductor. A n-type dopant introduces a higher electron concentration to the semiconductor, producing a n-type semiconductorn-type refers to the 1},

We infer that the low Galactic latitude structure is at a fairly constant distance of R=18+/-2 kpc from the Galactic center above the Galactic plane and has R=20+/-2 kpc in the region sampled below the Galactic plane. The evidence includes 500 Sloan Digital Sky Survey spectroscopic radial velocities of stars within 30° of the plane. The velocity dispersion of the stars associated with this structure is found to be 27 km s-1 at (l,b)=(198deg,-27deg), 22 km s-1 at (l,b)=(225deg,28deg), 30 km s-1 at (l,b)=(188deg,24deg), and 30 km s-1 at (l,b)=(182deg,27deg). The structure rotates in the same prograde direction as the Galactic disk stars but with a circular velocity of 110+/-25 km s-1. The narrow measured velocity dispersion is inconsistent with power-law spheroid or thick-disk populations. We compare the velocity dispersion in this structure with the velocity dispersion of stars in the Sagittarius dwarf galaxy tidal stream, for which we measure a velocity dispersion of 20 km s-1 at (l,b)=(165deg,-55deg). We estimate a preliminary metallicity from the Ca II (K) line and color of the turnoff stars of [Fe/H]=-1.6 with a dispersion of 0.3 dex and note that the turnoff color is consistent with that of the spheroid population. We interpret our measurements as evidence for a tidally disrupted satellite of 2×107 to 5×108 Msolar that rings the Galaxy.},

The data is from two long, narrow stripes, each with an opening angle of greater than 60 deg, at Galactic latitudes 36 {\textless} abs(b) {\textless} 63 on the celestial equator. An examination of the sample's distribution shows that these stars trace considerable substructure in the halo. Large overdensities of A-colored stars in the North at (l,b,R) = (350, 50, 46 kpc) and in the South at (157, -58, 33 kpc) and extending over tens of degrees are present in the halo of the Milky Way. Using photometry to separate the stars by surface gravity, both structures are shown to contain a sequence of low surface gravity stars consistent with identification as a blue horizontal branch (BHB). Both structures also contain a population of high surface gravity stars two magnitudes fainter than the BHB stars, consistent with their identification as blue stragglers (BSs). From the numbers of detected BHB stars, lower limits to the implied mass of the structures are 6x10{\textasciicircum}6 M\_sun and 2x10{\textasciicircum}6 M\_sun. The fact that two such large clumps have been detected in a survey of only 1\% of the sky indicates that such structures are not uncommon in the halo. Simple spheroidal parameters are fit to a complete sample of the remaining unclumped BHB stars and yield (at r {\textless} 40 kpc) a fit to a halo distribution with flattening (c/a = 0.65+/-0.2) and a density falloff exponent of alpha = -3.2+/-0.3.},

	abstract = {Electron-electron (e-e) collisions can impact transport in a variety of surprising and sometimes counterintuitive ways. Despite strong interest, experiments on the subject proved challenging because of the simultaneous presence of different scattering mechanisms that suppress or obscure consequences of e-e scattering. Only recently, sufficiently clean electron systems with transport dominated by e-e collisions have become available, showing behavior characteristic of highly viscous fluids. Here we study electron transport through graphene constrictions and show that their conductance below 150 K increases with increasing temperature, in stark contrast to the metallic character of doped graphene. Notably, the measured conductance exceeds the maximum conductance possible for free electrons. This anomalous behavior is attributed to collective movement of interacting electrons, which 'shields' individual carriers from momentum loss at sample boundaries. The measurements allow us to identify the conductance contribution arising due to electron viscosity and determine its temperature dependence. Besides fundamental interest, our work shows that viscous effects can facilitate high-mobility transport at elevated temperatures, a potentially useful behavior for designing graphene-based devices.},

It is Pure Mathematics, and it is sure to appeal to the budding pure mathematician. In this new introduction to undergraduate real analysis the author takes a different approach from past studies of the subject, by stressing the importance of pictures in mathematics and hard problems. The exposition is informal and relaxed, with many helpful asides, examples and occasional comments from mathematicians like Dieudonne, Littlewood and Osserman. The author has taught the subject many times over the last 35 years at Berkeley and this book is based on the honours version of this course. The book contains an excellent selection of more than 500 exercises.},

The library processes asynchronous transfer mode (ATM) cells, ATM adaptation layer 5 (AAL5) frames, Internet protocol (IP) messages, and user datagrarn protocol (UDP) packets directly in hardware. Applications can process data at several layers of the protocol stack using the library of wrappers discussed in this article. Layers are important for networks because they let applications abstract from above and below details of the network protocols. At the lowest layer, networks modify raw data passing between interfaces.

In this type of task we are interested in producing a classifier that specifically characterizes a subgroup of interest by maximizing the difference in predictive performance for some outcome between subgroups in a population. We discuss adapting maximum margin classifiers for differential prediction. We first introduce multiple approaches that do not affect the key properties of maximum margin classifiers, but which also do not directly attempt to optimize a standard measure of differential prediction. We next propose a model that directly optimizes a standard measure in this field, the uplift measure. We evaluate our models on real data from two medical applications and show excellent results.},

	abstract = {Machine learning (ML) models, e.g., deep neural networks (DNNs), are vulnerable to adversarial examples: malicious inputs modified to yield erroneous model outputs, while appearing unmodified to human observers. Potential attacks include having malicious content like malware identified as legitimate or controlling vehicle behavior. Yet, all existing adversarial example attacks require knowledge of either the model internals or its training data. We introduce the first practical demonstration of an attacker controlling a remotely hosted DNN with no such knowledge. Indeed, the only capability of our black-box adversary is to observe labels given by the DNN to chosen inputs. Our attack strategy consists in training a local model to substitute for the target DNN, using inputs synthetically generated by an adversary and labeled by the target DNN. We use the local substitute to craft adversarial examples, and find that they are misclassified by the targeted DNN. To perform a real-world and properly-blinded evaluation, we attack a DNN hosted by MetaMind, an online deep learning API. We find that their DNN misclassifies 84.24\% of the adversarial examples crafted with our substitute. We demonstrate the general applicability of our strategy to many ML techniques by conducting the same attack against models hosted by Amazon and Google, using logistic regression substitutes. They yield adversarial examples misclassified by Amazon and Google at rates of 96.19\% and 88.94\%. We also find that this black-box attack strategy is capable of evading defense strategies previously found to make adversarial example crafting harder.},

	abstract = {Plasma is a proposed framework for incentivized and enforced execution of smart contracts which is scalable to a significant amount of state updates per second (poten-tially billions) enabling the blockchain to be able to represent a significant amount of decentralized financial applications worldwide. These smart contracts are incentivized to continue operation autonomously via network transaction fees, which is ultimately reliant upon the underlying blockchain (e.g. Ethereum) to enforce transactional state transitions. We propose a method for decentralized autonomous applications to scale to process not only financial activity, but also construct economic incentives for globally persistent data services, which may produce an alternative to centralized server farms. Plasma is composed of two key parts of the design: Reframing all blockchain compu-tation into a set of MapReduce functions, and an optional method to do Proof-of-Stake token bonding on top of existing blockchains with the understanding that the Nakamoto Consensus incentives discourage block withholding. This construction is achieved by composing smart contracts on the main blockchain using fraud proofs whereby state transitions can be enforced on a parent blockchain. We compose blockchains into a tree hierarchy, and treat each as an individual branch blockchain with enforced blockchain history and MapReducable computation committed into merkle proofs. By framing one's ledger entry into a child blockchain which is enforced by the parent chain, one can enable incredible scale with minimized trust (presuming root blockchain availability and correctness). The greatest complexity around global enforcement of non-global data revolves around data availability and block withholding attacks, Plasma has mitigations for this issue by allowing for exiting faulty chains while also creating mechanisms to incentivize and enforce continued correct execution of data. As only merkleized commitments are broadcast periodically to the root blockchain (i.e. Ethereum) during non-faulty states, this can allow for incredibly scalable, low cost transactions and computation. Plasma enables persistently operating decentralized applications at high scale.},

In this paper, we suggest a non-dominated sorting-based MOEA, called NSGA-II (Non-dominated Sorting Genetic Algorithm II), which alleviates all of the above three difficulties. Specifically, a fast non-dominated sorting approach with O(MN2) computational complexity is presented. Also, a selection operator is presented that creates a mating pool by combining the parent and offspring populations and selecting the best N solutions (with respect to fitness and spread). Simulation results on difficult test problems show that NSGA-II is able, for most problems, to find a much better spread of solutions and better convergence near the true Pareto-optimal front compared to the Pareto-archived evolution strategy and the strength-Pareto evolutionary algorithm - two other elitist MOEAs that pay special attention to creating a diverse Pareto-optimal front. Moreover, we modify the definition of dominance in order to solve constrained multi-objective problems efficiently. Simulation results of the constrained NSGA-II on a number of test problems, including a five-objective, seven-constraint nonlinear problem, are compared with another constrained multi-objective optimizer, and the much better performance of NSGA-II is observed},

	abstract = {Human mobility data has been ubiquitously collected through cellular networks and mobile applications, and publicly released for academic research and commercial purposes for the last decade. Since releasing individual's mobility records usually gives rise to privacy issues, datasets owners tend to only publish aggregated mobility data, such as the number of users covered by a cellular tower at a specific timestamp, which is believed to be sufficient for preserving users' privacy. However, in this paper, we argue and prove that even publishing aggregated mobility data could lead to privacy breach in individuals' trajectories. We develop an attack system that is able to exploit the uniqueness and regularity of human mobility to recover individual's trajectories from the aggregated mobility data without any prior knowledge. By conducting experiments on two real-world datasets collected from both mobile application and cellular network, we reveal that the attack system is able to recover users' trajectories with accuracy about 73\%{\textasciitilde}91\% at the scale of tens of thousands to hundreds of thousands users, which indicates severe privacy leakage in such datasets. Through the investigation on aggregated mobility data, our work recognizes a novel privacy problem in publishing statistic data, which appeals for immediate attentions from both academy and industry.},

	abstract = {The Physics of Stars, Second Edition, is a concise introduction to the properties of stellar interiors and consequently the structure and evolution of stars. Strongly emphasising the basic physics, simple and uncomplicated theoretical models are used to illustrate clearly the connections between fundamental physics and stellar properties. This text does not intend to be encyclopaedic, rather it tends to focus on the most interesting and important aspects of stellar structure, evolution and nucleosynthesis. In the Second Edition, a new chapter on Helioseismology has been added, along with a list of physical constants and extra student problems. There is also new material on the Hertztsprung-Russell diagram, as well as a general updating of the entire text. It includes numerous problems at the end of each chapter aimed at both testing and extending student's knowledge.},

	abstract = {Personnel selection research provides much evidence that intelligence (g) is an important predictor of performance in training and on the job, especially in higher level work. This article provides evidence that g has pervasive utility in work settings because it is essentially the ability to deal with cognitive complexity, in particular, with complex information processing. The more complex a work task, the greater the advantages that higher g confers in performing it well. Everyday tasks, like job duties, also differ in their level of complexity. The importance of intelligence therefore differs systematically across different arenas of social life as well as economic endeavor. Data from the National Adult Literacy Survey are used to show how higher levels of cognitive ability systematically improve individual's odds of dealing successfully with the ordinary demands of modern life (such as banking, using maps and transportation schedules, reading and understanding forms, interpreting news articles). These and other data are summarized to illustrate how the advantages of higher g, even when they are small, cumulate to affect the overall life chances of individuals at different ranges of the IQ bell curve. The article concludes by suggesting ways to reduce the risks for low-IQ individuals of being left behind by an increasingly complex postindustrial economy.},
